&GT;&GT; [BLEEP].<BR/>IT'S GETTING REAL.
&GT;&GT; HOW DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOR<BR/>TIME WITH COLTON WAS?
&GT;&GT; TOO SHORT.
&GT;&GT; YEAH.
&GT;&GT; SO I'M KIND OF CATCHINGD<BR/>FROM OTHER GIRLS, AND JUST
BECAUSE YOU HAVE STOLEN CON<BR/>THREE TIMES ALREADY, IT'S
DEFINITELY RUBBING PEOPLE E<BR/>WRONG WAY.
I THINK IT IS ALMOST A LITE<BR/>DESPERATE AND I DON'T KNOWF
YOU HAVEN'T HAD, LIKE, GOOD<BR/>CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM, BUI
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT U<BR/>LET OTHER GIRLS TAKE TIME H HIM.
&GT;&GT; I'M SORRY IF I STEPPED N<BR/>THEIR TOES AND I'M SORRY II
INSULTED ANYONE OR WAS TOO<BR/>AGGRESSIVE OR I LOOKED
"DESPERATE," WHICH IS HILA,<BR/>BY THE WAY.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?<BR/>HE'S MY PRIORITY.
&GT;&GT; COLTON IS EVERYONE'S<BR/>PRIORITY.
I'M JUST SAYING, LIKE, REST<BR/>EVERYONE.
&GT;&GT; I DON'T THINK THAT I HAE<BR/>DISRESPECTED ANYBODY.
MY TIME WITH HIM WAS VERY .<BR/>I SPOKE WITH HIM PROBABLY 0
SECONDS THE FIRST TIME, MA,<BR/>LIKE ‐‐
&GT;&GT; IT WASN'T 30 SECONDS.
&GT;&GT; I KNOW YOU THINK IT WAS<BR/>LONGER BUT IT REALLY WASN'T
LONGER THAN, LIKE, 30 SECOR<BR/>A MINUTE.
&GT;&GT; OKAY.
[LAUGHS]
&GT;&GT; DON'T LAUGH LIKE THAT.
&GT;&GT; NO, I MEAN, I KNOW I TOK<BR/>HIM FROM YOU AND I WAITED A
LONG TIME TO MAKE SURE YOU,<BR/>LIKE, PLENTY OF TIME TO TAO
HIM BEFORE I WENT AND STOL.
&GT;&GT; I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE WH<BR/>YOU. I AM, LIKE, THE LEAST
ARGUMENTATIVE PERSON.
&GT;&GT; YEAH, NO, DEFINITELY.
&GT;&GT; I DO NOT WANT ANY BAD BD<BR/>AT ALL.
&GT;&GT; YOU DON'T WANT BAD BLOOO<BR/>HONESTLY, I AM LOOKING OUTR
YOU AT THIS POINT.
&GT;&GT; I GET THAT, THAT IS WHYI<BR/>UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARET
THAT I TALKED TO HIM A COUF<BR/>TIMES AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE.
&GT;&GT; I'M HERE TO KEEP IT REAH<BR/>YOU, WITH COLTON, WITH EVEE HERE.
&GT;&GT; CHEERS TO THAT.<BR/>KEEPING IT REAL.
&GT;&GT; CHEERS TO THAT.<BR/>HONESTLY, I FEEL GOOD ABOUT
THIS CONVERSATION. I HOPE YOU DO.<BR/>I HOPE YOU KNOW WHERE ‐‐ HW
PEOPLE FEEL.
&GT;&GT; IF YOU DON'T HAVE HATER,<BR/>YOU'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.
&GT;&GT; YEAH. HATERS.
&GT;&GT; [LAUGHS]
&GT;&GT; YEP.
&GT;&GT; I FEEL LIKE THE CONVERSN<BR/>WENT WELL.
&GT;&GT; THAT WAS A GOOD CHAT.
&GT;&GT; EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS A LE<BR/>DEFENSIVE, I THINK I GOT TH
TO HER, AND SHE WON'T BE<BR/>STEALING COLTON AGAIN.
&GT;&GT; THANKS FOR LETTING ME K.
&GT;&GT; THERE IS A HUG.
&GT;&GT; HUG IT OUT.
&GT;&GT; SO I GOT SOMETHING FOR .
&GT;&GT; "FIND THE SILVER LINING"
&GT;&GT; 'CAUSE IT'S REALLY, REAY<BR/>HARD TO BE IN THIS SITUATI,
HAVING TO MAKE THOSE REALLD<BR/>DECISIONS ‐‐
&GT;&GT; EXCUSE ME. HI.<BR/>CAN I HAVE ANOTHER FEW MOMS
&GT;&GT; OH. UM, OKAY.
&GT;&GT; GOOD.
&GT;&GT; THANK YOU.
&GT;&GT; YEAH, THANK YOU.
&GT;&GT; HI, AGAIN.
&GT;&GT; HOW ARE YOU?
&GT;&GT; AMAZING.<BR/>HOW ARE YOU DOING?
&GT;&GT; FOURTH TIME'S A CHARM.
&GT;&GT; IT IS.
&GT;&GT; AS I WAS WALKING AWAY, N<BR/>WAS LIKE, "OH, FOURTH TIMEE
CHARM."<BR/>AND I WAS LIKE, YEAH, REAL?
REALLY?
&GT;&GT; SO I WAS JUST TALKING TO<BR/>COLTON.
&GT;&GT; YAY!
&GT;&GT; OKAY. YOU GO, GIRL.
&GT;&GT; SO THAT WAS GREAT BUT IT<BR/>INTERRUPTED ‐‐
&GT;&GT; BY WHO?
&GT;&GT; WHAT'S HER NAME?<BR/>THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THE DO?
&GT;&GT; WAIT, WAIT, WAIT ‐‐
&GT;&GT; CATHERINE INTERRUPTED Y?
&GT;&GT; I WALKED AWAY AND HE SA,<BR/>"FOURTH TIME'S THE CHARM."
&GT;&GT; FOUR TIMES?<BR/>THAT'S UNHEARD OF.
&GT;&GT; I THINK EVERYONE SHOULDA<BR/>CHANCE TO HAVE TIME TO TALO HIM.
EVERYONE.<BR/>SO ‐‐ AND I TOLD HER THAT.
&GT;&GT; WHAT THE HELL?<BR/>I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE STOLE N
AGAIN. I THOUGHT WE HAD A GREAT<BR/>CONVERSATION.
WE HUGGED IT OUT AFTERWARDD<BR/>EVERYTHING.
BUT OBVIOUSLY SHE DOESN'T E<BR/>AT ALL.
&GT;&GT; AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S A<BR/>LITTLE EXCESSIVE, FOR SURE.
&GT;&GT; NOT EVEN A LITTLE EXCES.
&GT;&GT; IT'S A LITTLE MUCH.
&GT;&GT; ACTUALLY EXCESSIVE.
&GT;&GT; IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING<BR/>BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WAITING
PATIENTLY AND BEING RESPECL<BR/>TO ALL THE OTHER GIRLS TO Y
TIME AND CATHERINE IS BEING<BR/>STRAIGHT UP RUDE.
&GT;&GT; HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT<BR/>SOMEONE COULD INTERRUPT SOY
TIMES AND THERE ARE SO MANY<BR/>PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T HAD TIM?
&GT;&GT; A LOT OF GIRLS HAVEN'T D<BR/>TIME TO TALK TO HIM YET.
