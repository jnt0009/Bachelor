So happy.
And it's just‐‐<br/>I feel really good with you.
I feel like myself with you,
and I haven't felt that way<br/>in a long time.
‐ I feel good with you too.

‐ Um...
This is a conversation<br/>that I have to have, um...
in relationships because<br/>it's a part of who I am,
it's a part of my story.

It's, um, it's like,<br/>not an easy thing
for me to talk about.

But it's something<br/>that's really important,
especially in relationships,
because it's<br/>something that, um...
has come in between,<br/>like, intimacy
and just a lot of different<br/>things in my life.

Um...so four years ago,<br/>I was a sophomore in college.
It was actually four years ago<br/>in October, so...
2014 of October.
And, um, me and three<br/>of my girlfriends
went to one<br/>of my friends' houses,
and they‐‐they drugged<br/>our wine.
Um, I woke up<br/>the next morning
and I was completely naked<br/>in my bed
and had no memory<br/>of the night before.
And I had, like, a small vision<br/>of a guy in my bed.
And I was like‐‐I just had<br/>this pit in my stomach,
like, something really bad<br/>happened last night.
And my girlfriend<br/>called me and said
the three of us were<br/>all sexually assaulted.
Um, her and<br/>my other girlfriend
passed out in a bed<br/>at the party,
and two men came in<br/>and had sex with them
in the same bed<br/>at the same time
while they were incapacitated.
And...
then the girlfriend
who didn't drink the wine<br/>called me and told me
not only did a guy come home<br/>and have sex with me,
um, another guy...
I was passed out on a couch<br/>from the drugs,
and he was like,<br/>"Watch what I'm about to do,"
with all his fraternity<br/>brothers around me.
And lifted up my dress,<br/>while they watched and laughed
and took photos<br/>and Snapchats and...
Um, it was horrible.<br/>It was absolutely horrible.
And I did everything<br/>that I was supposed to do.
I went to the police<br/>the next day.
I tried to get a rape kit done.
I was turned away<br/>by a hospital,
which is illegal.
And I went to another hospital.<br/>They did a rape kit.
Um, the results<br/>were inconclusive,
because so much time<br/>had passed
because the first hospital<br/>turned me away.
And the men got away with it,<br/>except for one.
One of them did get expelled.
The rest of them<br/>got away with it.

‐ I can't even imagine,
like, going through<br/>something like that.

And I know, like,<br/>talking about it's not easy.

And like, the‐‐the fact that,<br/>like, that happened
to you is devastating.

‐ We all handled it<br/>very differently.
I was determined to get justice<br/>and seek justice.
And it's‐‐it's like,<br/>it's something
that will always<br/>be a part of me
and will always come up<br/>in relationships,
and that's why I wanted<br/>to bring it up to you,
because, like, I did‐‐<br/>I struggled with
the shame and guilt<br/>that I had felt.
‐ It's the most difficult<br/>thing in the world.
It is so painful,<br/>and it's‐‐and it screws up
every ounce of you.
Like, I mean, it‐‐it took<br/>months for people‐‐like,
men would like,<br/>touch my shoulder
or graze my shoulder<br/>or bump‐‐like,
and I was triggered.
And I couldn't‐‐it was awful.
I had to take all of my‐‐like,<br/>I couldn't leave my house.
It was so, so bad.
‐ Who helped you get through
everything that you<br/>went through?
‐ Mm.
I like‐‐I wasn't able to<br/>open up about it
for a long time.
I didn't tell my parents,<br/>because I felt so ashamed
and so guilty.
And she found out one day.
‐ Your mom?<br/>‐ Yeah.

And I told her everything.
The next day she went<br/>and met with the dean,
and then she met with<br/>my attorney,
um, and she started<br/>fighting immediately.
And I don't know why I hid it<br/>from her for so long.
I hid it from her<br/>for almost a year.

I don't know, it's been‐‐<br/>it's been hard,
but, like, it shaped me<br/>as a person,
and it's made me so strong
and like, made me the person<br/>that I am today.
And I‐‐and I like to be happy<br/>and goofy and fun,
but it's like...<br/>‐ Yeah.
‐ It's like a dark part<br/>of my history,
but I'm not gonna let that,<br/>like, diminish me or who I am.

‐ I want you to know, like,<br/>with me, you're safe.
‐ I do feel that.<br/>‐ Good.
‐ I feel so safe with you.
Like, I've never felt this way<br/>in a relationship,
so safe and so comfortable.
‐ Yeah.
‐ I really appreciate...
taking this so well,
'cause that's a fear<br/>in relationships.
It's like‐‐a lot of people<br/>don't know how to handle it,
and a lot of people clam up<br/>and tense up and freak out.
‐ Yeah.
‐ And...
And you haven't.
And I really appreciate just...
I really appreciate you.

‐ Come here.

I have had a situation<br/>in my past where...

I was in a relationship...
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ In which<br/>she was sexually abused.

And...

And for me,<br/>that was the hardest thing
I ever had to watch.
Going through something<br/>with someone,
looking into her eyes<br/>and just knowing, like...

the pain associated with it.
‐ Yeah.
‐ And...
Like, who am I to feel the pain<br/>when I wasn't the victim?
‐ I don't think<br/>that's true, though,
because I've seen...

like, how it's‐‐how it's<br/>affected my family,
affected my‐‐it's affected<br/>every single person in my life.
Like, it's not just something<br/>that I've been through.
It's something that<br/>everyone in my life
went through with me.
‐ Yeah.
I think that that's one thing<br/>people will never understand
is like, the intimacy<br/>that goes along
with what you've experienced.<br/>‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ And I've been on<br/>the other side of it.
‐ Yeah.<br/>Mm‐hmm.
‐ And for me,<br/>for that to be my...
my first love,<br/>and like, the first person
who like, I found,<br/>like, for me.
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ And it didn't happen.
And opening up last year<br/>about my virginity
wasn't the easiest thing to do.
‐ Right.

‐ But I think, like,<br/>the thing I realized
is everybody who asked me<br/>is like,
"Why are you a virgin?"
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ They expect<br/>this simple answer.
‐ Mm‐hmm.<br/>‐ They want a reason.
‐ Yeah.
‐ And my reason's complicated.

‐ Thank you.
Thank you for being able<br/>to open up to me too.

‐ Yeah.
‐ You know, I think that's...
maybe why I feel so safe<br/>with you.
‐ Yeah.

You're incredibly strong,<br/>you know that?
‐ Thank you.

<i>I will be patient with you,</i>
<i>but the moment that you try</i><br/><i>my character,</i>
<i>I'm done with you.</i>
All bets are off at this point.
‐ Hey, Court.
‐ I would like to take a poll.
Raise your hand<br/>if you think
I'm the cancer of the house.
‐ What?
‐ I would never<br/>use those words ever.
‐ Why?<br/>That's what I said.
‐ I'm the cancer of the house.
‐ You said that?<br/>‐ You said that about her?
‐ Yeah.<br/>‐ Why?
‐ Why?
‐ Because I do feel that way.<br/>I feel like you are.
‐ Bomb!<br/>Here we go, it's happening.
‐ In what ways?
‐ I just‐‐that's how I feel.
I feel like you are the cancer<br/>of the house.
‐ Because I had a calm<br/>and concise conversation?
‐ You did not have<br/>a calm and concise
conversation with me, dude.
You were mean to me.
‐ And that is how<br/>you reacted to me.
And I said,<br/>"Let's bring it down.
Let's have a conversation."
‐ No, that's not how<br/>you were at all.
You were mean,<br/>you attacked me,
you said crazy things<br/>about my character.
‐ I didn't attack you.<br/>‐ Yes, you did.
‐ But I think I should have.
‐ You already did, Courtney.<br/>‐ I was very calm.
I was very concise.
‐ No, you attacked me.
You said the meanest things<br/>people have ever said to me
in my life that night.
You said I was playing God.
You said that I‐‐you insinuated<br/>that I had no class.
You questioned how old I was
when we're the same<br/>[bleep] age.
‐ Because your maturity<br/>sometimes is very telling.
That doesn't mean<br/>I'm being mean,
but sometimes you act<br/>very immature.
‐ No, you were very mean.
‐ Like, I think you should<br/>probably take a time‐out.
‐ I am so not in the wrong<br/>in this situation.
She is only attacking me
because of her own<br/>insecurities.
‐ Maybe I should warn him<br/>about you.
‐ I'm sure that you did,<br/>Courtney.
I have no doubt in my mind
that you talked<br/>mad [bleep] about me.
‐ I think your personality<br/>is ridiculous.
‐ ...day one that you would‐‐
You said, "I thought I had<br/>a big personality
"until I met Demi.
Demi has such<br/>a big personality."
‐ Because it's absolutely<br/>ridiculous
on a different scale,<br/>and that was my way
of "complimenting" you.
‐ No, because I'm secure<br/>in myself.
‐ I love that you feel like<br/>you need to yell.
‐ [scoffs]<br/>‐ You have so much class.
‐ Okay, you have nothing left<br/>to say, clearly.

‐ Normally, I don't let<br/>ladies in my bed
on the first date, but...

‐ Ugh.<br/>I'm so pissed.
‐ You‐‐you put us<br/>in this situation.
‐ You're mentally unstable.
‐ Wait, wait, wait, wait.
‐ You are a liar.<br/>‐ I hate this.
‐ [bleep]'s gonna go down,<br/>but Colton needs to hear it.
‐ Yeah.

‐ Oh, boy, look what we got.
‐ Oh, thank you.<br/>‐ What's this?
‐ I have no clue.

OFFRED: Previously on<br/><i>The Handmaid's Tale...</i>
GUARDIAN 2: We got her!<br/>JUNE: No!
HANNAH: Mommy!
This is the new one.
I'm Commander Waterford.
May God make me truly worthy.
SERENA JOY: He is my husband.
Don't get any ideas.
Fertility is a gift<br/>directly from God.
You girls will serve<br/>the Leaders of the Faithful
<i>and their barren wives.</i>
<i>You will bear</i><br/><i>children for them.</i>
Welcome to the friggin'<br/>loony bin.
Blessed are the meek, dear.
OFFRED: <i>What'd they do to her?</i>
"If my right eye offends thee,<br/>pluck it out."
OFFRED: <i>He's the</i><br/><i>Commander's driver.</i>
<i>Maybe he watches me.</i>
There's an Eye<br/>in your house.

<i>Be careful.</i>
OFFRED: <i>My name is June.</i>

OFFRED: <i>Blue.</i>

<i>I let it take me.</i>

<i>Blue Moon.</i>

<i>Rhapsody in Blue.</i>
<i>Tangled Up in Blue.</i>
<i>Blue Oyster Cult.</i>
<i>Blue Monday.</i>
<i>Our car was that color.</i>
<i>We bought it off Craigslist.</i>

<i>It smelled like maple syrup.</i>
<i>Luke said</i><br/><i>it was a leak in the radiator,</i>
<i>it was probably bad for kids.</i>
<i>After we got it fixed,</i><br/><i>I missed that smell.</i>

<i>And so did Hannah.</i>

Hi.
Blessed be the fruit.

May the Lord open.

(INDISTINCT VOICES<br/>ON WALKIE‐TALKIE)

We should go.<br/>It's gonna pour.

Would you like to<br/>take the long way?
You're going to<br/>get caught in the rain.

I like the rain.

Okay, whatever.

We're going home.

Under His eye.<br/>BOTH: Under His eye.

Do you think<br/>it's safe to talk here?
If we're careful.
Are you from here?
Brookline.<br/>You?
Missoula, Montana,<br/>if you can believe that.
I moved here for school.

Do you work in the city?<br/>Or did you?
OFFRED: I was an assistant<br/>book editor.
After my daughter<br/>Hannah was born,
it was part‐time but sometimes<br/>it was just paperwork.
But we did novels<br/>and academic titles.
Once we did nine volumes<br/>on the history of falconry.
Oh, man.
Actually, that sounds like<br/>it'd be fun to me right now.

Yeah, it kind of<br/>sounds amazing.

OFGLEN: I worked<br/>at the university.

Lecturer in cellular biology.
OFFRED: Wow.
I thought<br/>all the college professors
were sent<br/>to The Colonies or...
I have two good ovaries.
So they were kind enough<br/>to overlook my sinful past.

Lucky me.

(BUILDING CREAKING)
(THUDDING)
(DRILLING)

OFFRED: St. Paul's.

That was my dad's parish.

My daughter<br/>was baptized there.

They took down St. Patrick's<br/>in New York City.
Blew it up<br/>and dumped every stone
in the Hudson River.

They fucking erased it.
(THUDDING AND RUMBLING)

And how do you know that?
How do you know<br/>there's an Eye in my house?
