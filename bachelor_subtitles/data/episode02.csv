120,dialogue,,colton,hannahb,"I don't know about that, but...",2
121,dialogue,,hannahb,colton,We'll see. I might mix things up.,2
122,testimony,,hannahb,aside,"Talking in front of everybody is terrifying. But Colton's gonna make this whole thing better. Hopefully if I see him in the audience or something, it'll make me feel more calm.",2
123,dialogue,,demi,nick,"""So I was so nervous and excited and when he showed up he was hot as *bleep*.""",2
124,dialogue,,nick,demi,"They frown on using the phrase ""hot as *bleep*.""",2
125,dialogue,,megan,nick,"No, they say dirty words on ""The Bachelor"" all the time.",2
126,dialogue,,nick,megan,"Oh, they do.",2
127,testimony,,demi,aside,"I hope that Colton sees that I am bold and I am out there. The other girls, they're gonna have some sappy stories, they're gonna have some love stories. They're gonna have some, like, deep stories about maybe their childhood or something. But nobody's gonna have a story like mine.",2

139,sound,cheers and applause,,,,2
140,testimony,,hannahg,aside,I'm excited for Colton to get a glimpse of my past. And I want to hear about his past too. I want to hear Colton's story.,2
141,dialogue,laughter,colton,crowd,"So for most of my adult life, I had a secret. I was a virgin. And as an athlete, I thought I had to fit this mold. I made up lies. And I was uncomfortable speaking my truth. One day I get to the locker room, and one of the veterans asks me; he said, ""How many girls have you slept with?"" So I sat there sweating. ""What's a good lie? Is it one? Four? Ten? 100?"" ""What am I gonna do?"" It finally came out of my mouth, and I said, ""Zero."" And I didn't know what the reaction was gonna be, and I was expecting to get ridiculed. And the first thing that I heard was, ""Wow, man, that's really cool."" For so many years, I allowed this to be a burden on my life. Uh, and it was unnecessary. But for the first time, I told the truth about my virginity. Thank you.",2
142,sound,cheers and applause,,,,2
143,dialogue,,nick,crowd,"Thank you, Colton. One day I hope to make love to Megan.",2
144,dialogue,laughter,megan,crowd,"Yeah. We‐‐ We haven't gone all the way yet. He's got a lot of illustrated manuals that he still hasn't gotten through yet, and...",2
145,testimony,,elyse,aside,"I love that Colton is very comfortable in his skin. That speech, especially for a male to do that, with all the stereotypes that go into not only being an athlete, but just a male... it's pretty incredible.",2
146,dialogue,"laughter, all ooh‐ing",elyse,crowd,"I always dated men my age or maybe just a little bit older. You know, like, two, three, 13 years older. My 20s taught me a lot about life. But now I find myself in my very, very early 30s as‐‐ for the first time, dating a younger man. And, Colton... Now it's my turn to teach you a thing or two.",2
147,sound,cheers and applause,,,,2
148,testimony,,demi,aside,"Elyse, in her performance, she got up there, and she was willing to admit that she was older in front of everybody. I thought she was so brave for doing that. It was so bold of her. I mean, there's no advantage to being an older woman here.",2
149,dialogue,laughter,nicole,crowd,"Living in Miami, every single guy I've ever dated has either been Cuban, Colombian, or, like, a mix of the two. But everything was about to change because I was about to get the taste of the whitest bread I've ever tasted.",2
150,testimony,,nicole,aside,"I could just feel, like, Colton looking at me. He sees, like, that goofy side of me, and then he was cracking up the whole time. The fact that I made him laugh was, like, such a good, like, feeling.",2
151,dialogue,,hannahb,crowd,"School dance after school dance went by dateless. Most of the time I felt invisible. Fast forward to the other night. That feeling struck back again. And then you, Colton, handed me one of the most meaningful roses I've ever received.",2
152,sound,cheers and applause,,,,2
153,dialogue,,nick,crowd,I was touched by that. But it sort of took away from the rose that you gave me earlier today.,2
154,testimony,,catherine,aside,Some of the stories were super sincere.,2
155,dialogue,,bri,crowd,This story is about the first time I felt comfortable in my own skin.,2
156,testimony,,catherine,aside,Some of them were a little more aggressive.,2
157,testimony,"laughing, cheers and applause",onyeka,aside,"I grab my whistle and my lifeguard gear, and I saved him from drowning in some bitches.  Let me just add, there are some thirsty girls here, so I had to do it. laughing]",2
158,testimony,,catherine,aside,But I can be aggressive too.,2
159,dialogue,"laughter, cheers and applause",catherine,crowd,"Someone came up to me and blew a whistle, actually, and said Colton was drowning in bitches. I'm a good swimmer. I'm Mike Phelps, *bleep*.",2
160,dialogue,,tracy,crowd,So my story is the first time I tried to date a virgin. It's sophomore year of college. There is this gorgeous fraternity president. And come to find out he's a virgin. This other girl in my sorority and I decided that we both really liked him and we were going to compete for him.,2
161,testimony,,nicole,aside,"Tracy kind of tells, like, the most dramatic story I've ever heard.",2
162,dialogue,,tracy,crowd,"And as I start to wake up, she punches me in the face.",2
163,testimony,,nicole,aside,She's caused someone to punch her in the face. So can you imagine what she is capable of here?,2
164,dialogue,,tracy,crowd,"When I got a hold of him, he was not a virgin anymore. But it was the best sex he ever had.",2
165,sound,cheers and applause,,,,2
166,testimony,,nicole,aside,"It was not a romantic story whatsoever. If I were Colton, I'd be like, ""Please get this girl away from me.""",2
167,dialogue,,megan,nick,What morals do we take from that story?,2
168,dialogue,"laughter, cheers and applause",nick,megan,"Well, I think that it is a cautionary tale for the other ladies in the house. And so we've come to our final storyteller‐‐Demi.",2
169,testimony,,demi,aside,I'm gonna tell a story that is going to blow the crowd's mind. And I just can't wait to make that crowd fall in love with me.,2
170,dialogue,all screaming,demi,crowd,"So I met this guy at this really crazy party. And I really wanted to kiss him, but I was just way too scared. Usually when I see something I want, I am bold enough to go after it immediately. And so I had to tell myself, ""I'm not waiting any longer. When I want something, I'm going after it.""",2
171,sound,all ooh‐ing,,,,2
172,testimony,,tracy,aside,"Demi is so immature. I'm not gonna lie, my stomach was starting to get a little tied in knots 'cause, like, I didn't want to sit there and see her kiss him.",2
173,dialogue,,demi,crowd,And that is the story of how I got the first group date rose.,2
174,sound,all cheering,,,,2
175,testimony,,tracy,aside,"Like, trust me, I want to kiss him just as much as the next girl does, but I also want to establish some type of connection with him so that I'm not just forcing it on him. Demi is such a child.",2
176,dialogue,,nick,crowd,"Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it one more time for Colton and the ladies.",2
177,sound,cheers and applause,,,,2
178,testimony,,demi,aside,"This date was the craziest thing of my life. I think that tonight I'm gonna have to definitely, like, show Colton some depth in me and give him a little more serious side of me. I just can't wait to, like, grab him and talk to him again.

218,dialogue,,nicole,women,"When Demi kissed him, I was just looking at his face, like, to gauge, like, if he was, like, enjoying it or not.",2
219,dialogue,,tracy,women,"I personally wouldn't go right up to him and kiss him right in front of you guys and I also wouldn't just force a kiss on him, because I would prefer for our first kiss to have meaning and him wanting it from the other side.
