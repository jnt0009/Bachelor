I want to be here for you.
I want to focus on<br/>a relationship
and I don't want‐‐<br/>I just wanted to be honest.
I mean, I‐‐I appreciate it.
‐ It's awkward to me.<br/>‐ I think‐‐
‐ I think while I try<br/>to stay focused
on our relationship,<br/>I mean...
you saying those things<br/>does concern me
because I did have<br/>a one‐on‐one
where I did get to know her,<br/>and I didn't see that, so...
‐ Yeah, yeah.<br/>‐ Like, I‐‐I'm just‐‐
I'm really trying to process<br/>everything right now.
and I think that's where<br/>it's, like, frustrating for me.
‐ Yeah.<br/>‐ Because I'm trying
to understand...<br/>‐ I'm sorry.
‐ I'm trying to understand it.
‐ I know.
Yeah.
<i>‐ I like Hannah a lot,</i>
especially after<br/>our one‐on‐one
and the time that we spent,
<i>but Caelynn tells me</i>
<i>that Hannah is manipulative,</i>
toxic, and all of those things
are very concerning.
Very powerful words.
<i>I mean, I feel</i><br/><i>caught off‐guard,</i>
and it makes me sick<br/>to my stomach
thinking about it.
<i>So I do want</i><br/><i>to get some answers.</i>
<i>I do want to get</i><br/><i>some clarity,</i>
<i>and I do want to know</i><br/><i>that I can trust my instincts.</i>
‐ Hello.
‐ Hey, how are you?<br/>‐ I'm good.
‐ Heather, do you mind<br/>if I talk to Hannah here?
‐ Yeah, take her away.<br/>‐ [laughs]
‐ All right.
‐ Do you want<br/>to sit right here?
‐ Yeah, I'll sit right here.<br/>‐ Okay.
‐ [sighs]<br/>‐ How are you?
‐ Good, I'm good.<br/>How are you?
‐ I feel better today.
The past few days<br/>have not been good.
‐ I know, I can agree.
Today I just want<br/>to hear from you.
I mean, I just‐‐I wanna<br/>move past this, because...
‐ I do too.<br/>‐ I wanna get back
to, like, where we were<br/>the night of our one‐on‐one.
‐ Okay.
‐ But when Caelynn<br/>talked to me...
your character did<br/>come into question.

And there just were
some alarming things,<br/>in my opinion, that were said.
‐ Okay.
‐ The words, uh,<br/>I'm caught up on‐‐
"manipulative,"
"toxic,"
and "deceitful."
Like, that is a big deal.
That is something that<br/>I'm not looking for.
‐ I'm not‐‐<br/>I'm not deceitful.
I'm not manipulative.
It's lies that<br/>just aren't true.
‐ If it's not true,<br/>why would she say that?
‐ I think because she's<br/>manipulative and fake.

She can put on a show of...
whatever Caelynn wants to be,
whatever version<br/>she wants to be
for whatever goal is in mind.
She's not showing<br/>all of who she is
when she's with you,
and I honest‐to‐goodness,<br/>like, believe
that if you picked her<br/>at the end...

you would never see<br/>the full person.
It makes me‐‐it, like<br/>breaks my heart for you,
and that's me being...
real and as honest<br/>as possible.

‐ Yeah.

[bleep].
[sighs]

I mean, it's just a lot<br/>for me to‐‐
‐ Absolu‐‐I mean, I know.
‐ Like, hearing<br/>you're deceitful
and you're saying<br/>she's being deceitful,
I feel like I'm going round<br/>and round in circles.
Like, that's why, like, for me<br/>this is so frustrating.
I guess I just don't know<br/>what to believe.
‐ Just freaking trust me.
I'm telling you the truth.

‐ I was hoping to have<br/>some sort of clarity,
and I still don't.
‐ Yeah.<br/>‐ And I feel like it's gonna
affect my relationship<br/>with Hannah and Caelynn.
I mean, the statement,<br/>like, Hannah said is,
"If you pick her, you're not<br/>gonna see the full her."
Like, that was a fear of mine<br/>coming into this.
‐ "Can somebody take<br/>advantage of me?"
‐ Do you think it's gonna<br/>affect your decision tonight?
‐ Could.
I just need to figure out<br/>what I want to do.
