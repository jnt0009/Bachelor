??? [to WOMEN]: It's starting to feel very small.
??? [to WOMEN]: I know.
??? [to WOMEN]: It's so crazy.
??? [to WOMEN]: It's so weird.
DEMI [to WOMEN]: That's crazy to think about.
HANNAHB: I woke up this morning feeling emotionally exhausted. Everybody in this house knows that Caelynn and I don't like each other. It is something that we came into this process with since Miss USA. And yesterday she told Colton that I'm manipulative, hostile, deceitful, and I don't know, like, how he's feeling. So I'm just hoping this week I just get some more validation from him that we're okay.
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: Morning.
??? [in exclamation]: What? 
WOMEN [to CHRIS]: Good morning, Chris.
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: Good morning. How's everybody feeling after yesterday, after last night? 
WOMEN [to CHRIS]: Good.
CHRIS [to HANNAHB]: Caelynn, how was it for you?
HANNAHB [to CHRIS]: Well, my name's Hannah.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Ooh.
CHRIS [to HANNAHB]: I'm sorry, Hannah. I'm sorry, Hannah. Caelynn's over there‐‐Hannah.
HANNAHB [to CHRIS]: Um, there were things said about me that should have never been said about me. And, um... I feel like I had to defend myself a lot. And just wasn't fun.
CAELYNN: She's like a gnat that just, like, won't go away. It's just an annoyance. I've moved on from the things that she's done to me, so I don't know why she's kinda still stuck in it.
HANNAHB [to CHRIS]: Just wasn't a good day, and I'm really tired of talking about what we've had to talk about.
CHRIS [to HANNAHB]: And yet, you're here.
HANNAHB [to CHRIS]: [sighs] By the hair of my chin.
[laughter]
CAELYNN: I came here for Colton. I didn't come here to talk about Hannah B. There's important things that I need to address with him, so I want to focus on us. And I'm hopeful that we can put these weird things in the past and continue on with our relationship.
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: Some bad news, there is no date today. The reason for that, it's time to take this thing to the next level. And to do that, we gotta get out of here.
[all squealing]
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Oh, my God. I'm so excited.
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: You'll be going to a place that we've actually never been in the history of the show.
[screaming and exclamations] 
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: It's about as far around the world as you can go.
??? [to CHRIS]: Oh, my God. Australia?
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: Ladies, pack your bags. You'll be meeting Colton in Singapore.
[screaming]
WOMEN [in exclamation]: No way! Shut up! What am I gonna wear to Singapore?
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: You leave in an hour.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: What? No. No, no, no, no.
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: So you may wanna get out of here and go pack your bags.
[cheering] 
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: Enjoy, enjoy. Drive safe. Enjoy.
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: Guys, I'm freaking out. 
ONYEKA: I'm so excited to go to Singapore. I'm so excited to see Colton. I know he hasn't left North America before, and I am far from an international travelling virgin. So it'll be nice to travel with one.
??? [to WOMEN]: Guys, I'm so excited.
DEMI: Me and Colton have had a lot of firsts together already. So could Colton lose his virginity in Singapore? Maybe. 
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Bye, America. We're going to Singapore.
[cheering]
HANNAHG: Where is Singapore?
[exciting music]
[cheering]
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Singapore. ‐ Yeah! Whoo. Singapore.
COLTON: We are in Singapore and it feels great. Singapore is amazing. It's got the lights, the buildings, and it's definitely a really cool place. So I'm ready to kick‐start this journey, travel the world, and find love.
VENDOR [to COLTON]: Hey, sir.
COLTON [to VENDOR]: Hey, can I get one of these?
VENDOR [to COLTON]: Sure, it's $2, sir.
COLTON [to VENDOR]: $2?
VENDOR [to COLTON]: Yep.
COLTON: The last week in L. A. was really tough, and it was one of the hardest weeks that I've had so far. I feel like with Caelynn and Hannah, I have to treat it how it is, and that is that they're not gonna get along with each other. So I just hope that those two could stay out of each other's way enough to allow me to really figure out what's there for us. So getting out of the country and having a fresh start, I'm very excited about that. And to be able to go through it with these women is something very special.
[upbeat music]
WOMEN [in exclamation]: When in Singapore... I know, I'm so excited.
NICOLE [to WOMEN]: To finding true love in Singapore. 
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Cheers!
NICOLE: I wanna go on a date with Colton, just us two, in Singapore. That's my freaking dream.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: I'm so excited. Yay, we're here. Whoo! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is amazing, oh, my goodness.
HANNAHG: I've never been in a hotel like this. From our room, we can see all of Singapore, which is so pretty. 
WOMEN [in exclamation]: This is beautiful. Oh, my gosh.
HANNAHG: But what would make this one million percent better is Mr. Colton.
CASSIE: Who knows what Colton's gonna have in store for us this week. This is kind of a big turning point, and I feel like we're at a good spot right now, so I want a one‐on‐one date, I do. I want one so bad. 
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Singapore!
[knocking at door]
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Date card. [overlapping chatter]
??? [to WOMEN]: I think we all want that one‐on‐one date this week.
??? [to WOMEN]: Sure.
??? [to WOMEN]: Especially in Singapore.
??? [to WOMEN]: Absolutely. Oh, yeah.
??? [to WOMEN]: It'd be a once in a lifetime experience.
[dramatic music]
??? [in exclamation]: Oh, my goodness.
ELYSE [to WOMEN]: "Tayshia, let's fall in love, Colton." 
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Aww! Oh, my God. This is so exciting. How fun!
HANNAHB [to TAYSHIA]: You're gonna have so much fun.
HANNAHB: It's frustrating, 'cause I know what happens on those one‐on‐ones. I know they're probably gonna have a good time. It's just like...[groans]
TAYSHIA [in exclamation]: Yes! So exciting!
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Yay.
DEMI: It sucks because I know I have so much to tell him. But if she didn't come back, that would be great. The less girls, the merrier.
COLTON: Good morning. [clears throat] Um, this is my first full day in Singapore. I don't think I'm jet‐lagged anymore, got a full night's rest. And today, I am taking Tayshia on our first one‐on‐one. Our relationship isn't as far along as the other ones are, but she's someone who's still, every time, like, I'm around, I can be myself. I can be happy. It should be a blast. I'm really hoping that today we don't die.
[gong chimes]
[exciting music]
TAYSHIA [in exclamation]: Oh, my gosh. This is so pretty.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Isn't it cool?
TAYSHIA: I'm really looking forward to my date, just hanging out with Colton uninterrupted.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Isn't this nice?
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Can we test the water?
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yes, of course we can.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: [laughs]
TAYSHIA: The date card says, "Let's fall in love." I think "Let's fall in love" means something with waterfalls, just 'cause we're right here by the water. Ooh. Oh, no.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Did you just get your foot drenched?
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: My feet are now soaked. 
TAYSHIA: Falling in love, I'm down with that. That feels good.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Did you see that?
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: What is that? Oh, my gosh.
??? [in exclamation]: [yelling] Whoo‐hoo.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: We should go bungee.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Colton, you're kidding, right?
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: No, we should go bungee.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Oh, my gosh.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Are you afraid of heights?
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Um... Not necessarily a fear of heights, but, like, I don't like falling. [laughs] What are your fears? Besides heights.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Heights. 
COLTON: I've never been able to have the opportunity to do something like this, because of my professional career, I never wanted to do something that I could be injured. So I always played it safe.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Are you kidding me?
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Oh, no way. 
COLTON: Now that I can do adventurous things, like, I'm looking forward to today.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: We got this. We got it.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yeah, yeah, we do.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Together, we do, right? Together we got this. Oh, my gosh, I'm freaking out.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Whoo.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Okay. We got it.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Here we go.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Let's do it.
COLTON: Life's all about experiencing things for the first time, and you really have to figure out what you like and what you don't like. So I'm gonna figure out today if I like heights.
TAYSHIA [in exclamation]: Oh, my goodness. [gasps] Look at it up here. This is incredible.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Oh, man, this is a lot higher than I thought it was gonna be.
COLTON [in exclamation]: [gasps]
TAYSHIA [in exclamation]: [laughs nervously] Oh, my God.
[tense music]
COLTON [in exclamation]: No way.
TAYSHIA [in exclamation]: Um...
COLTON [in exclamation]: Oh, man. 
COLTON: From afar, I thought, like, "Hey, this is gonna be a good idea." And then the closer we got up to it, I realized how high off the ground it was.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: A thousand feet.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Is that what it is?
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: I know, I'm gonna cry.
COLTON: I thought this was gonna be like a circus bungee jump, but this is like a legit bungee jump.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: It's fine. It's no big thing. Oh, my gosh, I think I'm gonna die. This is not okay.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: You ready?
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: I ready, yeah. [laughing] I'm ready.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: I don't believe you.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: I'm not.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: I'm not either. 
COLTON: Tayshia's really, really freaking out. I'm really, really freaking out too, so like, I probably just need to try to stay quiet and just jump and not make her more scared.
VENDOR [to COLTON]: All right, Colton, are you ready, man?
COLTON [to VENDOR]: Me?
VENDOR [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to VENDOR]: Okay. Was that convincing?
TAYSHIA: [laughs nervously] Least I got him by my side.
PRODUCER [to TAYSHIA]: How worried are you?
TAYSHIA: On a scale of 1 to 10, definitely a 20.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Have fun.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yep, this is fun.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Don't die. I'll see ya at the bottom. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
VENDOR [to COLTON]: Stand up straight.
COLTON [to VENDOR]: Okay. We're good?
VENDOR [to COLTON]: We're good. [indistinct] Four, three, two one.
COLTON [in exclamation]: [yelling] Oh, *bleep*. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, no, not again.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Colton!
COLTON [in exclamation]: Oh, my God.
TAYSHIA [to SELF]: No, no, not happening.
VENDOR [to TAYSHIA]: Didn't give you confidence?
TAYSHIA [to VENDOR]: No, not at all. He sounded like a little girl. Where is he? 
TAYSHIA [in exclamation]: Oh, my... I'm freaking out.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: I'm right here with ya.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: What am I doing?
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Hey, you got this, Tayshia. Jump to me, here we go!
VENDOR [to TAYSHIA]: You ready?
TAYSHIA [to VENDOR]: Yes.
VENDOR [to TAYSHIA]: Three...two...one... Go, go, go.
TAYSHIA [in exclamation]: [screaming] Oh, my God. Whoo‐hoo. [clapping] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
COLTON [in exclamation]: Yes.
TAYSHIA [in exclamation]: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [laughs] I can't believe it. [clapping] I did it.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: You killed it. That was awesome. Unbelievable.
TAYSHIA: Overcoming fear is a really good feeling, and it's amazing to have someone to do it with you.
[soft acoustic music]
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: [giggles] We did it. 
TAYSHIA: The date card said, "Let's fall in love." I'm taking those things very literally from now on. 
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Were you gonna chicken out, you think? Would you ever?
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Um, not with you up there.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: No?
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: No, you‐‐honestly, you were like, you seemed very confident while giving me the advice that I needed.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: It was only like that 'cause you were there. Otherwise, it would have been like, "Nope, thanks. Have a good day."
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Appreciate it.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Anytime. 
TAYSHIA: It's been quite some time since I've felt this open and vulnerable with a guy, but comfortable and secure at the same time. Colton and I have really good chemistry, and I think there is passion there. I can't wait for what's in store for tonight. I don't even know what's gonna happen. Whatever it is, I'm down, I'm ready. If I did the bungee jump, I can do honestly anything.
[gentle romantic music]
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: This is so cool.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yeah, it's beautiful.
TAYSHIA: Today has been amazing. We overcame our biggest fears together. And the fact that we did that on our first date is unreal. Love it.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yes.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: I love this. 
TAYSHIA: But tonight I need to remain fearless, because I have a little bit of a heavy subject to talk about with Colton. 
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Thank you.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yes.
TAYSHIA: It's kind of scary to talk to him about deeper and more personal things, but I'm just gonna live in the moment and trust him.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Today was awesome. I had so much fun.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Today was epic.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: I appreciate having you in my corner today.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: I appreciate you too.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: You have this confidence, and you have sort of this presence. It's very comforting.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Good.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: I wanna know how you can make me feel that way without even saying anything and how that smile never leaves your face. Like, that's what I wanna know. I wanna know how you are the way you are.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: I think I'm just a genuinely happy person.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yeah.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: But, um, it hasn't all just been, like, roses and everything like that. I've gone through some tough times too, and... Feel like I‐‐there's a lot to me that makes me, me.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yeah.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: And this past year and a half has been kind of hard for me, and it's actually because, um, I was married, and I got a divorce. I actually married my first boyfriend. And I was with him for about six years or so. I guess I could kinda sense we weren't doing very well.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yeah.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: And I think that's why I fought so hard, just to try to do as much as I possibly could. Being a Christian woman, you think, like, you get married once and that's gonna be it, and, um... You know, you expect that from your partner as well.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yeah.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: But you can't make someone want to be married, you know?
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Yeah.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: It's like the toughest thing I've gone through, and I think that's what's made me so strong, and fearless, if you will. Like, coming here to, like, meet you, if my fear would have stopped me, I would have regretted that, you know? Like, I would have missed all of this. I would have missed, like, my first bungee jump. And I would have missed getting to know how amazing you are.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Well, I'm glad you're here. And I know, like, that's not easy to talk about. I have divorced parents. I have learned that... I can't be the one to judge somebody's happiness.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: If you weren't happy, you're making the best choice and the best decision for you. Because you know what you want, you know what you deserve, and you're gonna do what makes you happy from here on out. And I know that.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: I appreciate that.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: And keep wearing that damn smile, because it is the sexiest thing.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: [laughing] Thank you.
[knocking at door]
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: I'll get it.
DEMI [to WOMEN]: This date card is about to clarify everything.
HANNAHB: I am pretty sure it's gonna be a group date. I would want to be on a one‐on‐one, obviously, but I'm glad to be on any date, as long as Caelynn doesn't get a one‐on‐one.
[dramatic music]
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: Hannah G...
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Whoo.
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: Elyse, Kirpa, Sydney...
[laughter]
??? [in exclamation]: One for yourself.
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: Heather, Onyeka, Tracy...
HANNAHB: One by one, people's names are just coming off the list.
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: Nicole, Demi...
DEMI [in exclamation]: Whoo.
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: Courtney...
HANNAHB: And I hadn't heard my name. I sure hadn't heard the other's name.
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: Katie, Cassie... And... Hannah B.
HANNAHB: She got the one‐on‐one.
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: "Let's get a taste of Singapore, Colton."
[cheering and exclamations]
[overlapping chatter]
??? [to SELF]: This is definitely my date.
CAELYNN: Oh, my God. [giggling] I'm crying.
HANNAHB: This was the most hurtful result that could have happened this week.
DEMI [to CAELYNN]: I don't know you Caelynn, and I don't know much about you at all, but it is frustrating to see even more time of his going to this whole situation, than somebody who hasn't been involved in that.
CAELYNN [to DEMI]: Okay. Fair‐‐your opinion is your opinion. I'm over it, I don't want to talk about it anymore. I've moved on, so...
DEMI [to CAELYNN]: But Colton, I feel like, hasn't.
[gentle piano music]
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: I had such a blast today.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Me too.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: And I really do appreciate you opening up too. 'Cause I know that's‐‐I know it's not easy to talk about.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: I think I‐‐I've learned a lot of, like, what to look for and what I need to have a successful relationship. And I know that when I do get married again, I'm gonna make sure it's amazing.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Well... Tayshia...
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Mm‐hmm?
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: I wanna let you know I'm so happy that you didn't let your fear of heights stop you from jumping. And also, I really appreciate you sharing your story with me tonight. So, Tayshia, will you accept this rose?
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Absolutely. [giggles]
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Come here.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Thank you.
TAYSHIA: This means a lot to me. Today was all about being fearless, being strong. We really elevated our relationship, and I think this is just the beginning. 
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Oh, my gosh. We're going on the Ferris wheel? This is so cool. I wanted to do this. Yay. Oh, my goodness.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Watch your step. 
COLTON: It was very nice giving Tayshia that rose. I hope that she continues to open up and she continues to grow and continues to just have trust in me. I'm very, very excited about Tayshia.
[cork pops]
TAYSHIA [in exclamation]: Oh, my God.
TAYSHIA [to COLTON]: Whoo!
TAYSHIA: This is definitely one of the most romantic moments of my life.
COLTON [to TAYSHIA]: Cheers.
TAYSHIA: I haven't felt this excited about a relationship in a really long time, and if this is just based off of one date, I cannot wait to explore what we can share in the future.
[uplifting music] 
TAYSHIA: I feel like these feelings are very real, and we have a really good foundation at this point. If things keep going at the way they're going, then I can definitely see myself falling in love with Colton.
[upbeat music]
COLTON: Today's group date is going to be a new challenge, because there are 13 women on this date.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: I am so excited. OMG, guys.
[indistinct chatter]
COLTON: The biggest challenge for me is trying to manage all the relationships. I wanna try to find my moments, but I don't like to do it in front of others. 
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Colton!
[cheering]
COLTON: I don't really do the in‐your‐face type physicality, because I don't know how to really, like, deal with that. 
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Oh, boy.
DEMI [to COLTON]: You smell amazing.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: How are ya? How are you? How you guys doing? You guys all look great.
WOMEN [to COLTON]: It's hot.
COLTON: I am excited to spend the day with these incredible women. Hopefully they keep an open mind to try new things and experience new cultures, because that's what this is all about. 
COLTON [to WOMEN]: You guys ready? 
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Yes.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Come on, let's go.
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Let's do it.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Oh, my God. Those are amazing. I'm like, "Can I stop?"
DEMI: Colton looks really good today, and I'm not intimidated by the fact that there's other people there, because I'm so focused on my relationship with him, and I'm gonna act how I would act if it were just me and him, and I'm gonna do whatever I need to do.
??? [to WOMEN]: Demi, we can get you one of those cute, little outfits.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Aww. Let's do it.
HEATHER: It's definitely weird having 13 of us all trying to, like, fight for his attention, but Demi definitely is the one who's like, on his back and flying around. I don't think anyone's gonna get time with Colton if she keeps going for it.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Check this out. Let's do me and you.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Us two?
DEMI [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to DEMI]: All right, let's go.
COURTNEY: Demi is trying to grab him every second and bring herself to the forefront.
??? [in exclamation]: Demi! Oh, my God. So cute.
COURTNEY: It's frustrating because I've had very limited time with him, and it's just like, I don't wanna have to battle with that on a date. So I'm hoping I can pull through and advance our connection, and then maybe I will get more time next week, I don't know.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: "The Leech Lady." I think we should go check this out.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Yeah? Leech Lady? Yes. Ooh. Oh, no. Okay. [screaming] Oh, my God. Oh...dun, dun, dun. Oh, my gosh. Oh, leeches.
HANNAHG: I walked up and I see this dude laying on, like, a bed, and he's got leeches on his back. Are we doing this or are we watching?
VENDOR [to WOMEN]: Welcome to Singapore, and you are now in the leech therapy house. We are doing a leech therapy. Enlarge the veins, get rid of toxics, and it gets rid of inflammations. You wanna try?
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Ooh.
COLTON [to VENDOR]: I'll try.
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Yes, Colton. Sure. You go first. You go.
VENDOR [to COLTON]: It's biting now, you feel it?
COLTON [to VENDOR]: Oh, yes, I feel it. [laughter] Yeah.
??? [in exclamation]: Ooh, little fatty.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: You guys wanna pet my leech?
[laughter]
COURTNEY: Is this even up to code? Like, where did they get these leeches from? Are they FDA approved? Like, I'm genuinely concerned.
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: It's almost like a‐‐ like a jellyfish sting. Every once in a while.
??? [in exclamation]: No, that's painful.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Here we go, Demi.
??? [in exclamation]: Whoo.
??? [to DEMI]: Did it latch that quick?
DEMI [to WOMEN]: He loves me.
DEMI: I'm feeding him my blood and he's loving it. I have the sweetest blood ever.
HANNAHB [in exclamation]: Is it on there? Oh, I don't feel it. I've been leeched. 
HANNAHB: I thought Caelynn stayed at home, but... the leech followed me here.
CAELYNN [to TAYSHIA]: Oh, gosh, I am so happy I'm not on that group date. 13 women fighting for time and just...
TAYSHIA [to CAELYNN]: Oh, my gosh.
CAELYNN [to TAYSHIA]: Trying to get a sentence in or trying to get eye contact. How was it yesterday in the house?
TAYSHIA [to CAELYNN]: Um, Hannah B.'s upset last night about me getting the one‐one‐one.
CAELYNN [to TAYSHIA]: Um, if she doesn't get the time that she wants or needs, I think it could be a repeat of behavior that we've seen before.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Yeah.
[indistinct chatter]
COLTON [to WOMEN]: I'm buying this. I feel like I look good in a fedora, huh?
HANNAHB [to Colton]: Uh, Colton.
HANNAHB: Even though I am excited to be here, it is definitely hard to know how to act. I've tried to, like, make conversation with him, and I feel like he doesn't, like, say anything back.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Whoa.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: What do we got here?
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Fortune teller. Fortune teller.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Cassie, you wanna do one with me?
CASSIE [in exclamation]: Okay, I'm nervous.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Come here. Come on.
HANNAHB: I feel like his attention is on all the girls, except me.
VENDOR [to COLTON]: You are the child of the winter. She is the spring and summer. That means she is your past life sister.
COLTON [to VENDOR]: Yeah. She's my past life sister. Oh, that's not what you wanna hear.
CASSIE [to VENDOR]: I'm his sister? [laughs]
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Hey, guys, this is my sister.
CASSIE [to VENDOR]: So we're siblings, I guess.
HANNAHB: I feel like he's avoiding me, because last week Caelynn said some things about me that are not true.
CASSIE [in exclamation]: That was depressing.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Well, now they're‐‐ now they're really happy.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: Yeah, I know.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: I love it.
HANNAHB: So I know he still has some concerns, so I'm trying not to get in my head about it, but I'm gonna get in my head about it.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Are you guys hungry?
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Yes.
COLTON [to VENDOR]: What is this?
VENDOR [to ALL]: Bullfrog. 
ALL [in exclamation]: Bullfrog. Bullfrog. Oh, my gosh. Are you gonna try it? They say frogs taste like chicken. How is it? It's good. It's good? 
COLTON [to WOMEN]: What is it? 
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Pig feet. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That's what I'm talking about. Ew. Is this eel? Then, no. Take just a little nibble out of it. Oh, my God. It's not‐‐it's good. It's good. Wow. Is that a fish eyeball? That was, like, a big deal. Hannah, you wanna try an eye? Me? Do it. Wait, will I die? You're gonna be fine. Come on, you got this. This is a big deal if I do this. Well, you're doing it, so it's a big deal.
HANNAHB: I am pretty open to at least trying a bite of anything.
WOMEN [to HANNAH]: Do it, Hannah.
??? [to HANNAHB]: If you do it, I'll do it.
HANNAHB: And right now I just want to impress him.
WOMEN [to HANNAHB]: Here we go. Eat it, eat it, eat it. Ready? One...two...three.. Just do it. Whoa. No, chew it. It's squirting. It's squirting. Ew.
HANNAHB: By George, I hope he realizes that I just ate a fish eye for him.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: I just wanna say thank you all, to trying new things. It's very important to me that my wife is adventurous and spontaneous. So to weird food and you guys. 
ALL [in exclamation]: Cheers. Yes, cheers. Cheers.
HANNAHB: I was told that eating the eye was good luck, and we all know after last week I need some luck. [laughs]
[upbeat music]
??? [to SELF]: Oh, I thought this was water.
[laughter]
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Oh, my God. Okay. Yes. Oh, my gosh. This is it. This place is amazing. Wow. It's gorgeous.
SYDNEY: Today was really, really fun, and I'm really excited to talk to Colton tonight. This is the biggest group date we've ever had. There's 13 people here, so how much time can you actually get?
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Did everybody have a good time? 
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Yes.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Yes, it was amazing. 
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Yeah!
COLTON [to WOMEN]: So much fun.
[indistinct chatter]
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Uh, Colton, can we go talk?
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: Yeah.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Awesome.
[dramatic music]
COURTNEY: There's 13 of us, and every single personality type is on this date. The more quiet and reserved people, the more loud and boisterous people. But I'm staying optimistic, and I'm excited to talk to him tonight. I'm just gonna be myself, and hopefully it works out in my favor.
ELYSE [to WOMEN]: I don't know, that was a quick snag at the beginning of the night.
??? [to WOMEN]: Yeah.
ELYSE [to WOMEN]: It's been like the elephant in the room.
NICOLE [to WOMEN]: What, Hannah B. and Caelynn? Yep.
??? [to WOMEN]: Yep.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: What happened, hopefully it's been dealt with, and it was left last week, and we did not bring it to another continent, and that's just what it needs to be.
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: Well, I think after last night's date card reading, it's clear that it didn't get left behind in L. A. I think it's definitely come with us here, and I think it's still an issue.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Today was really, really fun.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: I agree.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Like, I needed today, but last week was really hard.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: Yeah.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: It was really, really tough for me. And I think, like, the most important thing for a man is to know, I feel like, the woman that he's supposed to be with has noble character, and that you might not trust my character is really scary for me. And if I don't feel like you trust me, there's a part of me that just wants to step back, because I'm scared. And I don't want to, but I need to know that, like... you know who I am.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: Yeah.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: So I just wanna, like, make sure that... We're okay.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: As tough as the rose ceremony and going through the pool party and all that, I came to the conclusion that, like, I'm okay with you two, like, not seeing eye to eye.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Good.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: As long as it doesn't affect us. I wanna let you know, too, today, I felt like I got my Hannah back. I really did. And it was so nice to see you like that.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Mm‐hmm.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: And I'm sorry if at any point you thought I was being hard on you, but the only reason I was is because it was frustrating to me, because I liked you so much.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Well, I kinda like you too.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: Good.
[gentle romantic music]
HANNAHB: I am feeling very good about my conversation with Colton. I feel like it's a clean slate from all the negative energy that has been brought in from the outside. I mean, I thought I was gonna like him. Like, I knew there was gonna be attraction there, but I think it's a very big possibility that I could fall in love with him.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Did you have fun today?
CASSIE [to COLTON]: I did.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: I could tell.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: I had a lot of fun.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: I could tell you did.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: Really?
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Yeah.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: Except for... the fortune telling part.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: All right.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: That was weird.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: I wasn't gonna bring it up, but the fact that you brought it up, now we can get into it.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: You weren't gonna bring it up?
COLTON [to CASSIE]: No. The word I latched onto, he said, "brother and sister in a past life."
CASSIE [to COLTON]: Okay, yeah, "past life."
COLTON [to CASSIE]: So, it's not this life.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: I was like, "Oh, so, we're good." Right?
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Yeah. I don't know, I really believe that stuff.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: You do believe that stuff?
[laughing]
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Oh, shoot.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: I've been waiting all day to get you.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Oh, yeah?
CASSIE [to COLTON]: Yeah?
COLTON [to CASSIE]: I do know. I'm glad you did.
[soft acoustic music]
CASSIE [to COLTON]: Would your sister kiss you like that?
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Damn, you went there, huh?
CASSIE [to COLTON]: [laughs]
COLTON [to CASSIE]: That's not a kiss that a sister would give.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: No...
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Not that I would know.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: It's not.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: *bleep*. Oh, man, this is getting weird quick.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: I'm kidding. But it's true. [giggles]
COLTON: I feel like Cassie and I have an undeniable connection. She makes me so comfortable and really just allows me to be myself. I do feel like I've known Cassie much longer than I have. I'm not talking about in a brother‐sister way.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: That frickin' rose is sitting there looking at me, like, stop mocking me. Like, I would love to, like, be stress‐free and like, feel confident and like‐‐
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: Nobody feels stress‐free or confident here.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: I feel like people feel more confident than others for sure.
COURTNEY: Like, I wanna go into something confident, but I feel like people have had the opportunities to explore their connections, and that's why it's really important that I talk to him tonight.
KATIE [to COLTON]: I got us matching chopsticks.
[laughs]
COLTON [to KATIE]: I love this.
COURTNEY: It's really frustrating because I have been waiting patiently and being respectful to all the other girls.
SYDNEY [to COLTON]: I'm gonna wrap you up.
COLTON [to SYDNEY]: What kind of technique is this?
SYDNEY [to COLTON]: This is the mummification technique.
COURTNEY: I'm just trying to keep it together so that I can be in a place to talk to him. [sighs] I'm just frustrated.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: This line means you like a girl who got the first impression rose or something.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: There's so many of us. As the night goes on, like, he's just, like, getting, like, hankered down more and more and more and more. Like, I don't have a reason to feel confident right now at all.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: Courtney, I really just think that you need to, like, get out of your own head, because you are so much different than this.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: It's just easier said than done.
DEMI: Courtney has been pissed off for weeks here. Her approach seems pretty lazy in my opinion, because she hasn't done anything to get her time with him. I think that Courtney has dug her own grave at this point, and there's a chance that she could be going home.
[dramatic music]
DEMI [to COLTON]: I had fun today.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Yeah.
DEMI [to COLTON]: I really love just, like, going around looking at all the little shops and stuff and all of that cool stuff.
COLTON [to DEMI]: The tchotchkes?
DEMI [to COLTON]: Yes. You got us all kinds of stuff today.
COLTON [to DEMI]: The picture is your favorite thing.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Oh, yeah, because only me and you have that.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Exactly.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Um, I know you've seen such a fun, bold, crazy side of me, but there is a whole other side of me that, like, nobody knows about.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Yeah.
DEMI [to COLTON]: And a lot of stuff that I had to go through and still am going through right now. Um, there's some stuff going on back home, um, you know, that... it's, like, really hard for me to talk about. But...this week actually... [exhales deeply] My mom was released from federal prison. Having to see someone you love so much, like be‐‐be stuck in a place where they don't wanna be and, like, be, like, going through all of that stuff, and you just wanna, like, take them out of it. Like, my mom might be really messed up, but, like, that woman loves me so much, and, like, no matter what she does, I love her unconditionally.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Yeah. I know that's not easy to talk about, and I just want you to know, like, I'm not judging that at all.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Thank you.
COLTON [to DEMI]: You've been able to turn what most people wouldn't be able to turn into a positive or optimistic situation.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Mm‐hmm.
COLTON [to DEMI]: So it takes a pretty special person to be able to do that.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Thank you, Colton.
DEMI: It feels really good to get that off my chest. After having that serious of a conversation and just seeing how endearing he was, I know that he has feelings for me and I know he cares about me, and so it feels really good.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: It's frustrating watching him going out of his way to "make moments" with other people that aren't you, and it's like, "Am I just chopped *bleep* liver?" Like, why am I sitting here still? 
COURTNEY: It's difficult because I genuinely thought I was gonna get a one‐on‐one this week. And I keep getting group date after group date. It gives me anxiety, because I don't wanna have to talk over people or just, like, do something shocking for attention. So it's frustrating.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: He's taken time to point out to each of you sitting here that, like, you're special. I've gotten none of that.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: You know, like, I went up there and I had to talk to him about something I didn't wanna talk to him about, and I feel really good about it. And at the end of the day, you can't make excuses, you just have to act. Because if not, it's not gonna be good.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: I'll just wait patiently. Eventually, possibly, I'll talk to him.
DEMI: I spent over half my night trying to encourage Courtney to talk to Colton, and she did nothing but sit there, and I had a really good conversation with Colton earlier. So I wanna talk to him again, because I was just really happy to get that reaction from him, and it made me just like him even more.
DEMI [to COLTON]: [sighs] I've just been reflecting about everything...
COLTON [to DEMI]: Yeah.
DEMI [to COLTON]: And I've been thinking about, you know, how you reacted to what I told you.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Yeah.
DEMI [to COLTON]: And it felt really good.
COLTON [to DEMI]: It's nice to, like, see that side of you.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to DEMI]: And, like, shows me that you don't turn your back on family.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to show you.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Yeah.
KIRPA [to WOMEN]: Has everyone here chatted now?
??? [to KIRPA]: No, Courtney's still waiting.
KIRPA [to WOMEN]: People are already having double time, so you should get up there.
TRACY [to KIRPA]: Who's had double time?
KIRPA [to WOMEN]: Demi.
??? [to KIRPA]: She's up there again?
KIRPA [to WOMEN]: Yeah, so go.
WOMEN [to COURTNEY]: Go. Just go up there. If you leave tonight and you don't get time with him, that's not‐‐ You're gonna regret it. Yeah. Go. Do it. 
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: I'm so annoyed. 
WOMEN [to COURTNEY]: Do it. You can do this. You deserve it. You got it. You got this.
COURTNEY: Not only was a lot of the reason why I didn't talk to Colton because of Demi, but literally three to four minutes after I'm telling her that I'm upset that I hadn't talked to Colton yet, she's upstairs talking to Colton again.
[tense music]
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: Knock, knock, knock, knock. Hi, guys. Do you have company?
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: No.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: I was told that you were up here talking to Colton.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: Yeah, I know, I just came up here and told him thank you for our conversation that we had, and that was it.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: I don't understand that.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: What don't you understand?
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: I was open about being upset about not having time...
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: Mm‐hmm.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: With Colton. And, you know, you acted like you were genuinely concerned‐‐
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: And I was and I told you for like 30 to 45 minutes to go do something about it.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: Trust me, I tried. Trust me, I tried.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: You have no idea what's going on with me. 
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: You have no idea what's going on with me. You have no idea what I need to talk to him about.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: Instead of you trying to get that time with him‐‐
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: So stop playing God and deciding what you needed to say was more important.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: I didn't even think twice about you in our conversation we just had‐‐
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: And that's the thing, I feel like sometimes you don't think.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: Because I'm not here for all of the girls. I'm here for Colton.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: How old are you again?
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: Oh, stop it.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: I just feel like sometimes your actions and behaviors just kind of, like, solidify a maturity level, and it's just like someone with a little more maturity would kind of take those things into consideration.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: You know, you have the right to feel that way, and I have the right to not care, because you've been really rude to me in this whole entire conversation. So I'm over you.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: You think you've never been rude? You think your actions aren't rude? Do you think the words that you say aren't rude? I let them pass, because I'm just not gonna go there with you. 'Cause I was raised to respect people and carry myself with class and...
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: Well, thank you for letting me know how you feel.
[tense music]
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: Wish we had more respect for one another.
DEMI: Courtney is very intimidated by my confidence. I know that I have established a serious connection with Colton, and we're building on our relationship. Courtney told me that she was raised with class and insinuated that I wasn't, but it's like, Courtney puts the "ass" in class.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Well, it's that time of the night. Tonight has been great and has allowed me to continue to grow my relationships with each and every one of you. But tonight this rose is going to someone who has shown me a completely different side of themselves. Demi...
DEMI [to COLTON]: [moans]
COLTON [to DEMI]: Will you accept this rose?
DEMI [to COLTON]: Of course, come here. That was amazing. Thank you. My heart. Oh!
COLTON [to DEMI]: All right, well, I gotta get out of here. I wanna say one last thank you to all of you. You're amazing.
DEMI: I think it sent a huge message out to my haters, getting the rose tonight, because they tried to act like what I was doing wasn't the right approach, and that, you know, Colton wasn't gonna like that or whatever, and it just really shut them all up. 
DEMI [to WOMEN]: I was really scared to talk to him about what I had to talk to him about tonight, and so, I'm really glad that he appreciated it. I feel like it was a really big step for us, and it feels good.
COURTNEY [to SELF]: [sniffling]
[solemn music]
DEMI [to WOMEN]: I didn't expect this to happen at all, but, like, I'm really glad that it worked out.
COURTNEY [to NICOLE]: [crying] I'm really frustrated.
NICOLE [to COURTNEY]: I'm sorry.
COURTNEY [to NICOLE]: I mean, I'm sure he realizes like, the one person he didn't talk to and I'm sure he realizes that he talked to Demi twice. [sobbing]
NICOLE [to COURTNEY]: Yeah.
DEMI [to WOMEN]: This is what cloud nine feels like right now. Like, it feels really, really good.
COURTNEY [to NICOLE]: [sniffling] It's like, at this point, I just feel like I should just *bleep* go home. Like, there's no point in waiting. [sobbing]
WOMEN [to CAELYNN]: Hi. Hi, Caelynn. Oh, my gosh, you're glowing. [laughter] How you feeling?
CAELYNN [to WOMEN]: I feel good. I'm excited. I have no clue what I'm doing, so we'll see.
[knocking at door]
WOMEN [in exclamation]: [gasps]
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Ooh.
TELEGRAM [to WOMEN]: Hello.
WOMEN [to TELEGRAM]: Hi.
TELEGRAM [to WOMEN]: Hello. Which one of you is Caelynn?
CAELYNN [to TELEGRAM]: That's me.
TELEGRAM [to CAELYNN]: Oh, yeah?
[laughter]
CAELYNN [to TELEGRAM]: Thank you.
TELEGRAM [to CAELYNN]: Thank you. 
WOMEN [to TELEGRAM]: Thank you.
CAELYNN [to WOMEN]: Okay. Oh my... "I've been waiting for this special day for so long. Meet me downstairs, Colton."
[all cheering]
WOMEN [to CAELYNN]: Oh, my gosh.
CAELYNN [to WOMEN]:  What? [laughs] Okay, um, I'm gonna go.
[laughter]
CAELYNN [to WOMEN]:  All right, I love you guys. 
WOMEN [to CAELYNN]: Bye.
HANNAHB: It is what it is. Caelynn got a one‐on‐one, and I'm okay with it. But I wasn't like, "Oh, my God, girl, go kill it." Like, no. She was first runner‐up at Miss USA, and I didn't clap. I should have clapped for her when she walked out for her one‐on‐one. Dang it. That could have made it better.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Hi.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: How are you?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: What the heck? This is amazing.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: You look so beautiful.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Thank you. It's so good to see you.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: It's so good to see you.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: This is amazing.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: I couldn't think of anybody more deserving than you to spoil.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: What?
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: So why don't you say we get on out of here.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Yes.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: And go shop.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: This is amazing. [laughs]
CAELYNN: I am so happy right now. I was not expecting a date like this, and it's worth all the b.s. that's going on with Hannah B. I have him all to myself, and I'm excited.
[upbeat music]
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: I get to splurge like this every once in a while, so I gotta make sure when I do, it's for somebody I really like.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Oh. I can't stop kissing you.
HANNAHG [to HANNAHB]: That was the cutest butler that I've ever seen today.
HANNAHB [to HANNAHG]: Oh, he was so cute.
HANNAHG [to HANNAHB]: I feel like that's, like, part of their date.
HANNAHB [to HANNAHG]: Knowing Caelynn, I think that she'll really enjoy that.
HANNAHG [to HANNAHB]: Yeah.
HANNAHB [to HANNAHG]: Mm‐hmm. [laughing] That‐‐I'm not trying to be mean. I'm serious.
HANNAHG [to HANNAHB]: You're not mean.
HANNAHB [to HANNAHG]: I think she's going to love being pampered today. That's gonna be right up her alley. So I'm like, whatever, but I don't wanna talk about their relationship. I don't wanna think about their relationship. What if he buys her shoes and a dress?
HANNAHG [to HANNAHB]: Oh, shoot.
[exciting music]
VENDOR [to CAELYNN]: Hi, Lisa.
CAELYNN [to VENDOR]: Caelynn.
VENDOR [to CAELYNN]: Nice to meet you.
CAELYNN [to VENDOR]: Nice to meet you.
VENDOR [to CAELYNN]: Is this your first date?
COLTON [to VENDOR]: This is our first date alone.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Yes.
VENDOR [to CAELYNN]: Ooh. This dress would be stunning on you.
CAELYNN [in exclamation]: Oh, my gosh.
VENDOR [to CAELYNN]: It's one of our best sellers. So this is the equivalent of our little black dress.
CAELYNN [to VENDOR]: Yeah, I love that.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Here, you wanna go try it on?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Yeah. Oh.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Dang.
VENDOR [to CAELYNN]: Wow, that's beautiful.
CAELYNN [to VENDOR]: It's fun, I love it.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: You look amazing.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Thank you. I love this.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: We're getting it. 
CAELYNN: I'm not a person who, like, needs materialistic things, but to be spoiled like this is just so much fun to me.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Well, you're getting all that. Yes.
CAELYNN: [laughs] I am so happy right now.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Oh, man.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: This is fun.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: This is a lot of fun for me.
CAELYNN: I've never in my life been on a date like this. He was willing to spend the whole day catering to me. It was‐‐ it was really special.
VENDOR [to COLTON]: We're ready?
COLTON [to VENDOR]: How you doing?
VENDOR [to COLTON]: Wow. It's a stunner. Do you like that dress, Colton?
COLTON [to VENDOR]: No, I love this dress.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: It's fun.
VENDOR [to CAELYNN]: You're owning that dress.
COLTON: Every single time she tries something on she looks amazing.
VENDOR [in exclamation]: Oh, oh.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Damn.
VENDOR [to COLTON]: This is a show piece. Stunner.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: All of it.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: The whole thing.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: The whole thing.
COLTON: Caelynn and I just have this really good chemistry, and I have this energy and this excitement that I can't contain.
VENDOR [to CAELYNN]: Jennifer Lopez eat your heart out.
COLTON: Look at this. What we built today I hope that we can carry it over into tonight. I'm looking forward to it, and I think it's gonna be an amazing evening.
??? [to WOMEN]: The date card said, "Get ready for a day you'll never forget."
??? [to WOMEN]: Today was definitely glamorous.
??? [to WOMEN]: She's so pretty, I can't imagine her being more glam.
??? [to WOMEN]: I know, I agree.
KATIE [to WOMEN]: If I see her more glam, I'm gonna be like, "I'll go home now."
??? [to WOMEN]: Me too.
[door opens] 
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Hey. Oh, my gosh. No. Oh, my gosh. Shut up. My God. [indistinct chatter]
NICOLE: She can't even walk. She's like, "Hey, guys." And it's, like, a ridiculous amount of bags. Like, I've never seen so many shopping bags in my life. Like, I don't even get that many presents, like, on Christmas.
??? [in exclamation]: Oh, my God. [laughs]
NICOLE: She's there with the bags, like, glowing, like, she literally can't even stop laughing. Like, 'cause she's just, like, so happy. And we're all like, "Hee‐hee‐hee‐hee. Yay, this is wonderful."
CAELYNN [to WOMEN]: Yeah, I'm like, I‐‐ this does not feel real. We have a guy, like, pick us up in this Bentley, and we went to this Singaporean designer. He was like, "Whatever you want, it's on me." Colton picked these out himself, which like...
??? [to CAELYNN]: They're shoes. I love them. Stop. Oh, my God. Those are amazing. Like‐‐ Oh, my gosh.
NICOLE: It just seemed like he was super excited for their one‐on‐one date. And it was obvious he couldn't stop buying her things.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Ooh. Oh, my gosh. So cute. That is super cute. I love that. I love that.
CASSIE: I'm so mad. [laughs] It's not easy when I see someone that I'm dating now doing that to someone else. It's like...fine. It just sucks. But I love‐‐I am so‐‐ I am so happy for Caelynn. Like, I‐‐
[dramatic music]
[laughing]
[gentle music]
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: You look great.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: You look beautiful. I love this dress.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Glad I saved it, surprised you with it.
[laughs]
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Well, I love the fact that you surprised me.
CAELYNN: We had the best day today, Colton and I, and he is someone that I can see a future with and someone that, like, I feel could be the one for me. So tonight is important, because I have to talk to Colton about an experience that I've been though, and it's not a conversation that I enjoy having with anyone. There have been things that I've struggled with and that's intimacy. I like to be, like, this happy‐go‐lucky, goofy, fun person, um, but... it's a conversation we need to have.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: I can't get over that dress.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: [laughs]
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: You look gorgeous.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Thank you.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Yeah.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: You're not too bad yourself.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Today was a lot of fun.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Honestly, it would have been fun just going in the stores and trying things on. I didn't need all the gifts, but they are much appreciated.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: When they look like they did on you, when you just try them on, you have no option but to buy them.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: You're so sweet.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: And I mean that.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: I really don't think I would still be here if it was someone else.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Yeah.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: I mean, honestly, you make me so happy. So happy. And it's just‐‐ I feel really good with you. I feel like myself with you, and I haven't felt that way in a long time.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: I feel good with you too.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Um... This is a conversation that I have to have, um... in relationships because it's a part of who I am, it's a part of my story. It's, um, it's like, not an easy thing for me to talk about. But it's something that's really important, especially in relationships, because it's something that, um... has come in between, like, intimacy and just a lot of different things in my life. Um...so four years ago, I was a sophomore in college. It was actually four years ago in October, so... 2014 of October. And, um, me and three of my girlfriends went to one of my friends' houses, and they‐‐they drugged our wine. Um, I woke up the next morning and I was completely naked in my bed and had no memory of the night before. And I had, like, a small vision of a guy in my bed. And I was like‐‐I just had this pit in my stomach, like, something really bad happened last night. And my girlfriend called me and said the three of us were all sexually assaulted. Um, her and my other girlfriend passed out in a bed at the party, and two men came in and had sex with them in the same bed at the same time while they were incapacitated. And... then the girlfriend who didn't drink the wine called me and told me not only did a guy come home and have sex with me, um, another guy... I was passed out on a couch from the drugs, and he was like, "Watch what I'm about to do," with all his fraternity brothers around me. And lifted up my dress, while they watched and laughed and took photos and Snapchats and... Um, it was horrible. It was absolutely horrible. And I did everything that I was supposed to do. I went to the police the next day. I tried to get a rape kit done. I was turned away by a hospital, which is illegal. And I went to another hospital. They did a rape kit. Um, the results were inconclusive, because so much time had passed because the first hospital turned me away. And the men got away with it, except for one. One of them did get expelled. The rest of them got away with it.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: I can't even imagine, like, going through something like that. And I know, like, talking about it's not easy. And like, the‐‐the fact that, like, that happened to you is devastating.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: We all handled it very differently. I was determined to get justice and seek justice. And it's‐‐it's like, it's something that will always be a part of me and will always come up in relationships, and that's why I wanted to bring it up to you, because, like, I did‐‐ I struggled with the shame and guilt that I had felt.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Yeah.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: It's the most difficult thing in the world. It is so painful, and it's‐‐and it screws up every ounce of you. Like, I mean, it‐‐it took months for people‐‐like, men would like, touch my shoulder or graze my shoulder or bump‐‐like, and I was triggered. And I couldn't‐‐it was awful. I had to take all of my‐‐like, I couldn't leave my house. It was so, so bad.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Who helped you get through everything that you went through?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Mm. I like‐‐I wasn't able to open up about it for a long time. I didn't tell my parents, because I felt so ashamed and so guilty. And she found out one day.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Your mom?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Yeah. And I told her everything. The next day she went and met with the dean, and then she met with my attorney, um, and she started fighting immediately. And I don't know why I hid it from her for so long. I hid it from her for almost a year. I don't know, it's been‐‐ it's been hard, but, like, it shaped me as a person, and it's made me so strong and like, made me the person that I am today. And I‐‐and I like to be happy and goofy and fun, but it's like...
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Yeah.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: It's like a dark part of my history, but I'm not gonna let that, like, diminish me or who I am.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: I want you to know, like, with me, you're safe.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: I do feel that.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Good.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: I feel so safe with you. Like, I've never felt this way in a relationship, so safe and so comfortable.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Yeah.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: I really appreciate... taking this so well, 'cause that's a fear in relationships. It's like a lot of people don't know how to handle it, and a lot of people clam up and tense up and freak out.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Yeah.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: And... And you haven't. And I really appreciate just... I really appreciate you.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Come here. I have had a situation in my past where... I was in a relationship...
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Mm‐hmm.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: In which she was sexually abused. And... And for me, that was the hardest thing I ever had to watch. Going through something with someone, looking into her eyes and just knowing, like... the pain associated with it.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: And... Like, who am I to feel the pain when I wasn't the victim?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: I don't think that's true, though, because I've seen... like, how it's‐‐how it's affected my family, affected my‐‐it's affected every single person in my life. Like, it's not just something that I've been through. It's something that everyone in my life went through with me.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Yeah. I think that that's one thing people will never understand is like, the intimacy that goes along with what you've experienced.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Mm‐hmm.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: And I've been on the other side of it.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Yeah. Mm‐hmm.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: And for me, for that to be my... my first love, and like, the first person who like, I found, like, for me.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Mm‐hmm.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: And it didn't happen. And opening up last year about my virginity wasn't the easiest thing to do.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Right.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: But I think, like, the thing I realized is everybody who asked me is like, "Why are you a virgin?"
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Mm‐hmm.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: They expect this simple answer.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Mm‐hmm.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: They want a reason.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: And my reason's complicated.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Thank you. Thank you for being able to open up to me too.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Yeah.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: You know, I think that's... maybe why I feel so safe with you.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Yeah. You're incredibly strong, you know that?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Thank you.
[soft piano music]
CAELYNN: I feel like I've been through hell and back. But I think every time I open up it makes me stronger, and I'm able to take a little piece of me back that was broken by it. I'm way stronger than I ever imagined.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: You okay?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Mm‐hmm.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Okay.
CAELYNN: I wouldn't open up with him about this if I didn't feel so safe with him. Everything about our relationship feels natural and feels real and feels authentic. And... it just‐‐it‐‐it feels right. I don't think I've ever had like, a connection the way that Colton and I have one.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: So we have this whole place to ourselves, right?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: The whole place?
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Yeah.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: This is so beautiful. 
CAELYNN: It just feels like it's us. I know that I can definitely see myself falling in love with him. I just feel so confident in us.
[exciting music]
[dramatic music]
??? [in exclamation]: Oh, my gosh.
HEATHER: Tonight is the rose ceremony and I'm nervous.
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: Obviously, we're all very anxious to talk to him and say what we need to say, because there's only three of us that have roses, and people are going home tonight.
DEMI: Going into the ceremony tonight, there's a lot of things going on, a lot of emotions. There's still tension between Caelynn and Hannah Brown. Courtney is still in a funk. She still won't even look me in the eye. I tried to talk to her. She won't talk to me. It's really disappointing, but I am not surprised at all. 
DEMI [to WOMEN]: All right, girlies, I really think that everyone needs to make sure that they take the opportunity to get your time tonight, especially because there's gonna be some of y'all leaving.
TRACY: This issue with Courtney and Demi has been stewing or brewing or whatever for a while. I think it's only a matter of time until it comes to a head and explodes. 
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Hi.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Hey. You guys look amazing. How you guys doing?
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Good, how are you?
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Good, good. Singapore's been amazing, right? 
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Yes.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: It just gives me so much hope that at the end of this, I'm gonna be the happiest and luckiest man on the planet. So to all of you incredible ladies and to finding love. So cheers. 
ALL: Cheers.
HANNAHG: I feel good about where Colton and I stand. I feel excited and hopeful and I just want to hang out with him more. 
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Is this your place, seriously?
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: This is my room.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Look at you.
HANNAHG: There's definitely some sparks flying and chemistry between Colton and I, but I'm terrified to just put everything out on the line and really, really wear my heart on my sleeve. But it is important if I want this relationship to keep going forward. It means a lot that, like, even though your bed is perfectly made, I don't know if that's your thing, but like‐‐
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: I have a little OCD in me.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]:  I kinda do too. I kinda do too, I get it. But it means a lot that you brought me here. I do want us to, like, move forward.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Yeah.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: So I'm going to try really hard to open up, even though it's scary for me.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Okay.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: And, um... it's‐‐I'm not gonna be great at words, and I'm not gonna be great at saying what I need to say, because I am, like, comfortable around you, but it also makes me nervous to open up about those things, so...
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Yeah. I do want to get to know you more.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: 'Cause like, for me, it's like, in a way, like, I was like, "Man, I'm frustrated, because I really like Hannah G. so much"...
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Mm‐hmm.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: "And I don't know a ton about her."
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: But like, I do know I like the way you make me feel.
[gentle romantic music]
HANNAHG: Colton definitely made me feel good about telling him that I was nervous about opening up. I think Colton being understanding shows me his character and like, who he is, and that's something super attractive to me.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: I just want you to be comfortable.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Me too.
HANNAHG: I knew that Colton and I were like, on a really good path, but like, tonight he acknowledged me in, like, the biggest way ever. This is why I'm here. If Colton keeps on the track of how he was tonight, I see this becoming maybe something big. 
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: There we go. Are you folding it or are you just going straight down?
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: No, straight down.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Gotta be even.
NICOLE: It's been kind of a stressful night, I think, for everyone just because it's like, tension has been really high. There's been like, a lot of unspoken, like, business.
CAELYNN: Since my one‐on‐one, I've been thinking about all of the things that have been going on between Hannah B. and I. There's this unnecessary tension, unnecessary drama. It's a tough environment, and I get that, but at this point, enough's enough, and I'm over the *bleep*. 
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: Can I grab you for a sec?
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: Yeah.
ONYEKA: Hannah B. and Caelynn have had a very, um, hard relationship I would say. I'm not sure why Caelynn pulled Hannah B. aside, but I feel like *bleep* about to go down.
SYDNEY [to WOMEN]: I think this is the first time they've actually talked to each other and not to him, not to us about it.
DEMI [to WOMEN]: Exactly, exactly, exactly. They have been avoiding each other like the *bleep* plague.
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: Hello.
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: Hey. How are you?
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: Good. how are you?
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: Good. Okay. I just want to say there's been tension. There's been unnecessary drama. Like, I just‐‐I think we've both kinda been putting it off, like, we don't wanna address it.
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: Um, I mean, I've been thinking about wanting to talk to you and...
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: Yeah.
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: It has been uncomfortable. We used to be good friends and then we had a tiff, and I think it's okay for us to be a little upset. There is no getting around it.
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: But it's hard enough as women and hard enough as we've both been through such tough things, so I think my thing is, why not be supportive of one another? Let's put the past in the past. Let's squash this once and for all. Let's just, like, it's done. I'm not necessarily saying we're gonna be best friends...
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: I want to enjoy my time, and I feel like this has not made it as...
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: As enjoyable as it should be.
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: Yeah, and it's been‐‐ it's been frustrating, because I had to deal last week with stuff that I didn't ever wanna have to talk about. But...I‐‐I'm also aware that I think Colton has a relat‐‐ connection with you, and I know he has a connection with me. We're gonna hopefully be here.
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: Yeah.
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: And I don't, like, think you're a horrible person.
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: No, I‐‐I keep saying that. I'm like, I‐‐I don't wish anything bad upon you ever.
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: Yeah.
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: Truly, truly, truly, Hannah. Like, truly.
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: You know, whatever has been said and taken differently than it was supposed to, I'm sorry for that.
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: No, I apologize too.
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: So...
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: Yeah.
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: Yeah, I think it's good.
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: Me too.
HANNAHB [to CAELYNN]: I feel better.
CAELYNN [to HANNAHB]: Me too, I feel so much better.
HANNAHB: I do accept her apology. We don't have to be best friends and not necessarily that that's what we're trying to do, but at least it's just done, and World War III was averted tonight. 
CAELYNN: Let's go back in there and shake these girls up.
[laughter]
??? [to COURTNEY]: Are you feeling different from the other day?
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: I'm feeling better and a lot more optimistic. I just, you know, I don't know what's gonna happen tonight, and I hope I'm here, and I hope that people that don't deserve to be here... eventually aren't here anymore.
??? [to COURTNEY]: Do you think that people don't deserve to be here?
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: You know, it has everything to do with where you are in life and what you say and what you do and how you act. It's not a show, it's not like a show and tell, it's not a game.
DEMI: Courtney is a *bleep* joke. Like, there is nothing that ever comes out of her mouth that is really her. She's always putting on a show and saying, like, the craziest things that I've ever heard of.
ONYEKA [to DEMI]: Everything okay?
DEMI [to ONYEKA]: Yeah.
ONYEKA [to DEMI]: Okay.
DEMI [to ONYEKA]: Thank you.
ONYEKA [to DEMI]: Just making sure.
DEMI [to ONYEKA]: Yeah, no, thank you.
ONYEKA [to DEMI]: I know it's kinda hard, people‐‐you feel like‐‐
DEMI [to ONYEKA]: Well, it's like, I don't wanna be *bleep* mean to her, but I'm sort of tired of her throwing shade. I just wanna be like, "Shut the *bleep* up."
ONYEKA [to DEMI]: Do you think, like, Colton knows what went down between you guys?
DEMI [to ONYEKA]: I don't know. Do you think she's gonna talk to him?
ONYEKA [to DEMI]: You just literally never know.
DEMI: Yeah. I'm one of the nicest people in the world, but I'm tolerant until I'm not anymore. 
DEMI [to HANNAHB]: Do you mind?
HANNAHB [to DEMI]: Ugh, I guess you can steal our man.
DEMI: Maybe it's time for us to start being a little more honest. 
DEMI [to COLTON]: Um, I don't wanna talk about this long, 'cause I wanna get into the‐‐you know, whatever else I wanna talk about. But, uh, Courtney... She is like the cancer of the house. She, like, attacked me. Uh, she told me I was, like, playing God because I talked to you again that night, and I just wanted to tell you, like...
COLTON [to DEMI]: She‐‐she attacked you?
DEMI [to COLTON]: Yeah, but I mean, it didn't really faze me. But I did wanna tell you, because out of all of the women here, the one person who I think that is definitely not deserving of your heart is her, and I don't want you to, like, waste any more time on her. But‐‐I‐‐you know, I don't‐‐ it like, ugh... It, like, kills me to have to even talk about it at all.
COLTON: That's shocking to hear. I'm trying to wrap my head around it right now. I haven't had the most time with Courtney. But I like to trust my gut, and I definitely didn't see that coming. 
COLTON [to DEMI]: Not everybody gets along.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to DEMI]: But I definitely don't ever wanna hear somebody, like, attacks or somebody is verbally abusive.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to DEMI]: That's not right.
DEMI [to COLTON]: I don't know what she says to you, but I think that you're a smart guy, and you can probably see that for your own self. That's really all I wanna say about it.
COLTON [to DEMI]: All right.
[tense music]
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: Hey, guys.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: [laughs]
COLTON [to DEMI]: Appreciate you.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Appreciate you.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Yep.
COURTNEY [to COLTON]: How are you?
COLTON [to COURTNEY]: Good, how are you doing?
COURTNEY [to COLTON]: Um, you know. I would love to say that I'm doing good. But you know, I feel like I'm... you know, I just have to be honest, I'm‐‐I'm not doing the best. Last time I saw you was at the group date, and I didn't get to talk to you. I opened up to Demi about how I was upset, and she consoled me and told me like, "It's gonna be okay." She finished her sentence, got up, said she was going to the bathroom, went directly to talk to you for a second time. And you gave her the group date rose, and I knew that you probably didn't know what was going on.
COLTON [to COURTNEY]: I didn't know what was going on that night, but tonight sitting here with Demi, the words "attack" and you being "the cancer of the house" were brought to my attention.
COURTNEY: The "cancer of the house." Like, literally my worst enemy in the world would never say that about me. 
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: I think every single person in the house, especially myself, can agree that if anyone isn't here for the right reasons, it is Demi.
DEMI [to WOMEN]: And as I was walking out she said, "Well, I wish I could say I was doing good, but..." So I know she's just in there bashing me.
COURTNEY [to COLTON]: You only see this much of Demi. I see this much of Demi, and I see how she acts, and what she says and what she does.
DEMI [to WOMEN]: Nobody wants to be around her most of the time, because she is so negative. She complains all the time, and she makes everybody feel like crap.
COLTON [to COURTNEY]: I mean, so, you just told me the whole house thinks she's the cancer. She just told me the whole house thinks you're the cancer. I'm trying‐‐I'm...
COURTNEY [to COLTON]: I think what she said is the furthest thing from the truth. She isn't here for you. You could be anybody. The fact that you're the bachelor, and the fact that this is a TV show is the reason why she's here.
COLTON [to COURTNEY]: I mean, that's‐‐ for me, that's like, the worse thing to hear. Because like, that‐‐ coming into this, like, my greatest fear is someone that's here to win.
COURTNEY [to COLTON]: That's all she's ever said is that, "This is a game. I'm gonna play the game the right way."
COLTON [to COURTNEY]: She said that?
COURTNEY [to COLTON]: Yes, 100%.
COLTON: Hearing that is making me sort of question now my relationship with Demi. This is my worst nightmare and my greatest fear coming alive right now. Is the Demi that I see the real Demi or is she somebody else?
COLTON [to COURTNEY]: All right, well, I appreciate everything that you just told me. I really do.
COURTNEY: I'm a very kind, patient, loving, caring person until you press the wrong button, and that's not a button you wanna press. I'm not gonna let anyone step on me. I will be patient with you, but the moment that you try my character, I'm done with you. All bets are off at this point.
??? [to COURTNEY]: Hey, Court.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: I would like to take a poll. Raise your hand if you think I'm the cancer of the house.
??? [to WOMEN]: What? I would never use those words ever. Why? That's what I said.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: I'm the cancer of the house.
WOMEN [to DEMI]: You said that? You said that about her?
DEMI [to WOMEN]: Yeah.
WOMEN [to DEMI]: Why? Why?
DEMI [to WOMEN]: Because I do feel that way. I feel like you are.
ONYEKA: Bomb! Here we go, it's happening.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: In what ways?
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: I just‐‐that's how I feel. I feel like you are the cancer of the house.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: Because I had a calm and concise conversation?
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: You did not have a calm and concise conversation with me, dude. You were mean to me.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: And that is how you reacted to me. And I said, "Let's bring it down. Let's have a conversation."
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: No, that's not how you were at all. You were mean, you attacked me, you said crazy things about my character.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: I didn't attack you.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: Yes, you did.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: But I think I should have.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: You already did, Courtney.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: I was very calm. I was very concise.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: No, you attacked me. You said the meanest things people have ever said to me in my life that night. You said I was playing God. You said that I‐‐you insinuated that I had no class. You questioned how old I was when we're the same *bleep* age.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: Because your maturity sometimes is very telling. That doesn't mean I'm being mean, but sometimes you act very immature.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: No, you were very mean.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: Like, I think you should probably take a time‐out.
DEMI: I am so not in the wrong in this situation. She is only attacking me because of her own insecurities.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: Maybe I should warn him about you.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: I'm sure that you did, Courtney. I have no doubt in my mind that you talked mad *bleep* about me.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: I think your personality is ridiculous.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: ...day one that you would... You said, "I thought I had a big personality "until I met Demi. Demi has such a big personality."
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: Because it's absolutely ridiculous on a different scale, and that was my way of "complimenting" you.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: No, because I'm secure in myself.
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: I love that you feel like you need to yell.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: [scoffs]
COURTNEY [to DEMI]: You have so much class.
DEMI [to COURTNEY]: Okay, you have nothing left to say, clearly.
[tense music]
[excited chatter]
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: It is time for the rose ceremony.
[dramatic music]
ONYEKA: Going into this rose ceremony, there is just so much tension. Courtney and Demi have had a very hard relationship, I would say. We thought the big explosion at the group date a couple days ago was like, the big finale, but, I mean, no, that was not the finale. Tonight was the big finale.
CASSIE: Calling Courtney the cancer of the house was definitely not the right choice of words. But Demi has a rose, so Demi's safe. And who knows what Colton's gonna do?
COLTON [to WOMEN]: This week has been unbelievable, and I wanna say thank you for making this an unbelievable start to what is a great journey.
[tense music]
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Hannah G. Hannah, will you accept this rose?
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Absolutely, thank you.
HANNAHB: I can relate to what happened tonight between Demi and Courtney.
COLTON [to HEATHER]: Heather.
HANNAHB: I had a very similar situation last week with Caelynn.
COLTON [to HEATHER]: Will you accept this rose?
HEATHER [to COLTON]: Of course. Thank you.
HANNAHB: We ended up having, I think, a really good conversation for both of us to, like, move forward.
COLTON [to KIRPA]: Kirpa.
HANNAHB: But I'm nervous.
COLTON [to KIRPA]: Kirpa, will you accept this rose?
KIRPA [to COLTON]: Yes, thank you.
HANNAHB: This week I need Colton to give me validation that he wants me here. I need a rose tonight.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: Hannah B. Hannah, will you accept this rose?
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Yes.
COLTON [to KATIE]: Katie. Katie, will you accept this rose?
KATIE [to COLTON]: Absolutely.
DEMI: I really hope Courtney goes home tonight. There is no one else who deserves to be here less than her.
COLTON [to ELYSE]: Elyse.
DEMI: Tracy and me beef all the time, but literally, Tracy deserves to be here more than Courtney does.
COLTON [to ELYSE]: Elyse, will you accept this rose?
ELYSE [to COLTON]: Yeah, of course.
DEMI: I'm okay with having the balls to have to say to Colton, "Hey, there's a girl here who sucks."
COLTON [to SYDNEY]: Sydney.
DEMI: You know, maybe she could potentially not suck one day.
COLTON [to SYDNEY]: Will you accept this rose?
SYDNEY [to COLTON]: Yes.
DEMI: But as of right now, she sucks.
COURTNEY: Demi said that I am the cancer of the house.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Cassie.
COURTNEY: It just doesn't make sense, and you already have a rose. Like, I don't get it. Like, what are you trying to do?
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Cassie, will you accept this rose?
CASSIE [to COLTON]: Yes.
COURTNEY: The cancer of the house. I'm the furthest thing from that, and I would hate to leave with him believing that about me.
COLTON [to NICOLE]: Nicole. Nicole, will you accept this rose?
NICOLE [to COLTON]: Yes, I will.
CHRIS [to ALL]: Ladies, Colton, it's the final rose tonight. When you're ready.
[dramatic music]
COLTON [to ONYEKA]: Onyeka. Onyeka, will you accept this rose?
ONYEKA [to COLTON]: Absolutely.
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: Courtney, Tracy, I'm sorry. Take a moment. Say your good‐byes.
WOMEN [to WOMEN]: I love you. Bye. I hope you have an incredible time. Love you.
TRACY [to COLTON]: Bye. Thanks. Good luck with everything.
COLTON [to TRACY]: Thank you.
TRACY [to WOMEN]: Bye, guys.
COURTNEY [to COLTON]: Thank you for an incredible journey. 
COURTNEY: It says a lot about someone if you already have a rose and you decide to spend your one‐on‐one time bashing another female. 
COURTNEY [to COLTON]: I wish you the best of luck.
COLTON [to COURTNEY]: Thank you. I wish you the best too.
COURTNEY [to COLTON]: Actually, Demi is the cancer of the house. Down the line, he'll realize it, and if he doesn't realize it down the line, he'll realize it when it's too late, but I can't help him anymore now that I'm gone.
DEMI: Dreams do come true. Ding‐dong! The bitch is dead. Dr. Demi cut out the cancer. If Courtney would have listened to me and everything that I told her on that group date about changing her mentality and having a more positive attitude, she might still be here, but she made the mistake of *bleep* with me, and now she's out the door.
[dramatic music]
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Does anybody have any toasts?
DEMI [to ALL]: I do. To no more freaking leeches ever again!
