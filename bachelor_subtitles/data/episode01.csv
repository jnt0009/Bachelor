1,testimony,laughs,cassie,aside,"Hi, I'm Cassie, and welcome to Huntington Beach, California. I love the beach. I just like being out on the water. But I also enjoy working with people as well. I am a speech pathologist and a grad student. When I am working with a child and I see that I have helped them to communicate, it is probably one of the best feelings in the world. As a speech pathologist I'm supposed to be a good communicator and I really hope that that translates to when I go to meet Colton. I am so excited that Colton is the bachelor. Oh, my gosh. I am so nervous to meet him actually. My greatest hope is that when I meet Colton, we really click, and hit it off, and I leave with him.",1
2,testimony,,hannahb,aside,"Hi, I'm Hannah. Welcome to Alabama! I grew up in Titletown, home of the champions. I love Tuscaloosa, proud to be an Alabama fan. Roll tide! I'm miss Alabama, which makes me a queen here. Getting to serve my great state, that was truly a dream come true. It's fun. I have my own autograph pads. I always like to leave an encouraging message. Yeah, but I'm a total train wreck. I just am hoping that Colton will like the good, bad, and hot mess. The hot mess express and I'm the conductor.",1
3,exclamation,,hannahb,self,"C‐o‐l‐t‐o‐n, Colton, Colton, you're a ten!",1
4,testimony,,hannahb,aside,"So I've only kissed four guys that were my boyfriends. I am not a virgin, but sex a big deal so Colton is the bachelor and that he is a virgin is super appealing to me. I honestly couldn't believe people were like, ""what?"" I was like, oh, my God, it's so awesome. Like, it is so amazing. But then I am like, ""how?"". Colton, I hope you are ready for Alabama Hannah because Alabama Hannah is ready for you.",1

6,testimony,,katie,aside,"Hi, my name is katie, 26 years old and I am from the east coast. I came to L.A. because I wanted to dance. I love dancing. And as much as I love creative freedom and the arts, I'm a person who wants stability and security. The kind of love I hope to have one day is like my parents. They have been married for 30 years. They are inseparable. I love that. I want that. I am really excited to meet Colton because he has blonde hair, green eyes, athletic, super kind, kind of weird. I seem to have a very specific type. If he ends up liking the person I am and I end up loving the person he is, then 100%, I could be engaged at the end of this.",1
7,testimony,laughs,heather,aside,"Hi I'm Heather, I'm 22, and I was born and raised in California. If I'm not working, I am at the beach. I'm a beach girl through and through. I paddleboard, I am always in the water, always at the beach. But here's the thing, I hae never had sex before and I've never kissed anyone. ""Hey, I'm heather, I've never kissed anyone,"" that is really not my opening typically. I met Colton at his charity event in San Diego for 15 seconds. Took quick pictures, and is like, okay, I like that guy. Colton seems to have all the qualities that I'm looking for in a future husband. I could definitely see myself having my first kiss with Colton.",1
8,testimony,"laughs, laughs",onyeka,aside,"Hi, my name is Onyeka E. I am 24 years old and I live in Dallas, Texas. I grew up in a strong, traditional Nigerian family. My full name could not fit in the thing that they put down here. I am not afraid to embarras myself. Anyone who knows me knows I will do the weirdest thingn public. I'm loud and obnoxious at times. I do not care what people think about me. I think I'm a lot to handle. but I also have a really bg heart that comes with that. My parents are from Nigeria. They dated for two weeks and then they were engaged. I'm a firm believer in when you know, you know. Colton, he has all the morals, and all the characters I look for in a guy. And he's hot. If I was the person that Colton can gave his virginity to, I would definitely bring out all the tricks.",1
9,testimony,,nicole,aside,"Hola, me llamo Nicole y bienvenido a Miami. Being single when you are relatively attractive, it's hard because there are so many singles in Miami. So when I go out, you're not going to meet eligible bachelors. They're part of that hookup culture. I'm not about that. I'm looking for the real deal. My life in Miami is totally focused and centered on my family. My brother, A. J., suffers from autism. He is part of the package deal. He is going to be with me always. My mom and my grandma, my brother, are, like, my world. I'm so excited to meet Colton. I could just tell he would be so welcoming to, like, to my family and to my life.",1
10,testimony,"laughs, laughs",kirpa,aside,"Hi, my name is Kirpa. I'm a dental hygienist from Whittier, California. I really hope that Colton flosses, because being a dental hygienist, that is one of the first things I tend to gravitate to. It would be a good experienve to clean Colton's teeth. With Colton, that's as close as you can get right now, so I'll take it. I am blessed to have a fantastic family, a loving family from different backgrounds that loves each other. And puts up with one another. The only thing that has been missing is someone to share that with. The end of this, if it coud lead to an engagement, that would be amazing. Fingers crossed.",1
11,testimony,"laughs, laughs",demi,aside,"Hi, I'm Demi Burnett, 23 years old, and I'm hot doggin' for Colton. Vroom vroom! My friends and family would describe me as super bubbly and outgoing, a little sassy, country girl. I don't mind getting my has dirty and having fun. I've never had a serious relationship. I live with my dad and my stepmom. My dad always had the proper environment for us and so we've always been with him. My mom, she had to go to federal prison. She's there because of embezzlement. My mom is actually gonna get out very soon and the next time that I would potentiay see her would be with Colton. I'm really excited for Colton. I know that he's a virgin, it is kind of concerning. If you only ever have a vanilla cupcake, well, how do you know you don't like chocolate? How do you know you don't like strawberry? I feel like you got to try all the cupcakes first to know what you want. I am the damn confetti cake.",1
12,testimony,,colton,aside,"I'm Colton Underwood. I'm 26 and I never expected to be the next bachelor. I know not everybody's going to like me. I know I have a lot of room grow, but I also have an idea of what I want now. And that is what is so exciting about all this. I am the first virgin bachelor and it's crazy to even think about that. This is an opportunity of a lifetime, and I couldn't be more hopeful and excited. But then I also feel real nervous. Grade school Colton probaby would be really shy and timid, the fact that he was just named the bachelor. I grew up in a pretty conservative environment. I was at a Christian school I was always, like, the fat, chunky, awkward, weird kid. I didn't have girlfriends. I wanted to fit in so bad, but I felt very alone. A lot of days, I didn't want to go to school. My confidence in myself didn't come until my later years in high school. The one thing I knew how to do really well was football. When things were good, it was because of football. And that is why I got lost in it. I made it to the NFL. And for me, it was so special. I've had such a great life. I've had so many cool opportunities but the one thing I've been missing is somebody to share those with. I do know what love is. I mean, I've been in love before. And I remember how good I felt in those relationships. Falling in love with Becca was very eye‐opening. The comfort level was there chemistry was there. I was so open, I was so vulnerable. I was ready to really the next step. I was ready to lose my virginity to Becca. I was devastated when that relationship ended. And as tough and as challenging as that was, everything that has happened over the last year has been so transformative and so good for me. It's just the perfect time for me to focus on finding the person who I'm going to be spending the rest of my life with. I'm here to fall in love, and I'm here because I know how real it was when I was on the other side.",1
13,dialogue,,chris,colton,What's it like being announced the bachelor?,1
14,dialogue,,colton,chris,"For me, it was a little bit unexpected but it was something I was so grateful for, just the opportunity that I now knom going to have in front of me.",1

17,dialogue,,chris,colton,Of course.,1
18,dialogue,,colton,chris,"Some of the comments, I could see where they come I get it. They think I'm not ready. And it's a fine balance because I'm not here to do it for the fans or do it to win people over. I'm doing this for me.",1
19,dialogue,,chris,colton,"How much of the negativity and ""he's not ready"" do you think has to do with your virginity?",1
20,dialogue,,colton,chris,"That ‐‐ that's sort of thee stigma around being a virgin. Oh, he's not romantic, oh, he's not going to be a good bachelor.",1
21,dialogue,,chris,colton,That he's not a man.,1
22,dialogue,,colton,chris,"Yeah. And that got thrown at me this year. That was the thing, for the first time in my life, what I feared people might say to me actually got said to me. I mean, it is one of those things, I'm not waiting for a ring. I'm not waiting for marriage. I'm waiting to be in love. I'm waiting for it to feel right, to take our relationship to the next step.",1
23,dialogue,,chris,colton,"You are about to have women from all over the country coming here just to meet you. Do you believe in love at first sight? Do you think you will see a girl tonight and go, ""that's the one?""",1
24,dialogue,,colton,chris,I thought about that.,1
25,dialogue,,chris,colton,It's cool to think about.,1
26,dialogue,,colton,chris,"It is very cool to think about. But then, part of me, I don't want that because I just want to treat every relationship differently.",1
27,testimony,,colton,aside,"Being back here at the mansion reminds me that this works. This is real. And I am so humble and I ao grateful for this opportunity, but I am also so hopeful. This is my time. I am diving headfirst, and I'm going. And I can't wait to get started.",1
