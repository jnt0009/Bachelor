And... then the girlfriend who didn't drink the wine called me and told me not only did a guy come home and have sex with me, um, another guy... I was passed out on a couch from the drugs, and he was like, ""Watch what I'm about to do,"" with all his fraternity brothers around me. And lifted up my dress, while they watched and laughed and took photos and Snapchats and... Um, it was horrible. It was absolutely horrible. And I did everything that I was supposed to do. I went to the police the next day. I tried to get a rape kit done. I was turned away by a hospital, which is illegal. And I went to another hospital. They did a rape kit. Um, the results were inconclusive, because so much time had passed because the first hospital turned me away. And the men got away with it, except for one. One of them did get expelled. The rest of them got away with it.",4

822,dialogue,,colton,demi,She‐‐she attacked you?,4
823,dialogue,,demi,colton,"Yeah, but I mean, it didn't really faze me. But I did wanna tell you, because out of all of the women here, the one person who I think that is definitely not deserving of your heart is her, and I don't want you to, like, waste any more time on her. But‐‐I‐‐you know, I don't‐‐ it like, ugh... It, like, kills me to have to even talk about it at all.",4

840,dialogue,,courtney,colton,"Um, you know. I would love to say that I'm doing good. But you know, I feel like I'm... you know, I just have to be honest, I'm‐‐I'm not doing the best. Last time I saw you was at the group date, and I didn't get to talk to you. I opened up to Demi about how I was upset, and she consoled me and told me like, ""It's gonna be okay."" She finished her sentence, got up, said she was going to the bathroom, went directly to talk to you for a second time. And you gave her the group date rose, and I knew that you probably didn't know what was going on.",4
841,dialogue,,colton,courtney,"I didn't know what was going on that night, but tonight sitting here with Demi, the words ""attack"" and you being ""the cancer of the house"" were brought to my attention.",4

843,dialogue,,courtney,demi,"I think every single person in the house, especially myself, can agree that if anyone isn't here for the right reasons, it is Demi.",4
844,dialogue,,demi,women,"And as I was walking out she said, ""Well, I wish I could say I was doing good, but..."" So I know she's just in there bashing me.",4

846,dialogue,,demi,women,"Nobody wants to be around her most of the time, because she is so negative. She complains all the time, and she makes everybody feel like crap.",4
847,dialogue,,colton,courtney,"I mean, so, you just told me the whole house thinks she's the cancer. She just told me the whole house thinks you're the cancer. I'm trying‐‐I'm...",4
848,dialogue,,courtney,colton,"I think what she said is the furthest thing from the truth. She isn't here for you. You could be anybody. The fact that you're the bachelor, and the fact that this is a TV show is the reason why she's here.",4
849,dialogue,,colton,courtney,"I mean, that's‐‐ for me, that's like, the worse thing to hear. Because like, that‐‐ coming into this, like, my greatest fear is someone that's here to win.",4
850,dialogue,,courtney,colton,"That's all she's ever said is that, ""This is a game. I'm gonna play the game the right way.""",4
851,dialogue,,colton,courtney,She said that?,4
852,dialogue,,courtney,colton,"Yes, 100%.",4
853,testimony,,colton,aside,Hearing that is making me sort of question now my relationship with Demi. This is my worst nightmare and my greatest fear coming alive right now. Is the Demi that I see the real Demi or is she somebody else?,4
854,dialogue,,colton,courtney,"All right, well, I appreciate everything that you just told me. I really do.",4
855,testimony,,courtney,aside,"I'm a very kind, patient, loving, caring person until you press the wrong button, and that's not a button you wanna press. I'm not gonna let anyone step on me. I will be patient with you, but the moment that you try my character, I'm done with you. All bets are off at this point.",4
856,dialogue,,???,courtney,"Hey, Court.",4
857,dialogue,,courtney,women,I would like to take a poll. Raise your hand if you think I'm the cancer of the house.,4
858,dialogue,,???,women,What? I would never use those words ever. Why? That's what I said.,4
859,dialogue,,courtney,women,I'm the cancer of the house.,4
860,dialogue,,women,demi,You said that? You said that about her?,4
861,dialogue,,demi,women,Yeah.,4
862,dialogue,,women,demi,Why? Why?,4
863,dialogue,,demi,women,Because I do feel that way. I feel like you are.,4
864,testimony,,onyeka,aside,"Bomb! Here we go, it's happening.",4
865,dialogue,,courtney,demi,In what ways?,4
866,dialogue,,demi,courtney,I just‐‐that's how I feel. I feel like you are the cancer of the house.,4
867,dialogue,,courtney,demi,Because I had a calm and concise conversation?,4
868,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"You did not have a calm and concise conversation with me, dude. You were mean to me.",4
869,dialogue,,courtney,demi,"And that is how you reacted to me. And I said, ""Let's bring it down. Let's have a conversation.""",4
870,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"No, that's not how you were at all. You were mean, you attacked me, you said crazy things about my character.",4
871,dialogue,,courtney,demi,I didn't attack you.,4
872,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"Yes, you did.",4
873,dialogue,,courtney,demi,But I think I should have.,4
874,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"You already did, Courtney.",4
875,dialogue,,courtney,demi,I was very calm. I was very concise.,4
876,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"No, you attacked me. You said the meanest things people have ever said to me in my life that night. You said I was playing God. You said that I‐‐you insinuated that I had no class. You questioned how old I was when we're the same *bleep* age.",4
877,dialogue,,courtney,demi,"Because your maturity sometimes is very telling. That doesn't mean I'm being mean, but sometimes you act very immature.",4
878,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"No, you were very mean.",4
879,dialogue,,courtney,demi,"Like, I think you should probably take a time‐out.",4
880,testimony,,demi,aside,I am so not in the wrong in this situation. She is only attacking me because of her own insecurities.,4
881,dialogue,,courtney,demi,Maybe I should warn him about you.,4
882,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"I'm sure that you did, Courtney. I have no doubt in my mind that you talked mad *bleep* about me.",4
883,dialogue,,courtney,demi,I think your personality is ridiculous.,4
884,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"...day one that you would... You said, ""I thought I had a big personality ""until I met Demi. Demi has such a big personality.""",4
885,dialogue,,courtney,demi,"Because it's absolutely ridiculous on a different scale, and that was my way of ""complimenting"" you.",4
886,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"No, because I'm secure in myself.",4
887,dialogue,,courtney,demi,I love that you feel like you need to yell.,4
888,dialogue,scoffs,demi,courtney,,4

We thought the big explosion at the group date a couple days ago was like, the big finale, but, I mean, no, that was not the finale. Tonight was the big finale.",4
896,testimony,,cassie,aside,"Calling Courtney the cancer of the house was definitely not the right choice of words. But Demi has a rose, so Demi's safe. And who knows what Colton's gonna do?",4
