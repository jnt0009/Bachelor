[cheers and applause] 
CASSIE: Hi, I'm Cassie, and welcome to Huntington Beach, California. I love the beach. I just like being out on the water. But I also enjoy working with people as well. I am a speech pathologist and a grad student. When I am working with a child and I see that I have helped them to communicate, it is probably one of the best feelings in the world. As a speech pathologist I'm supposed to be a good communicator and I really hope that that translates to when I go to meet Colton. I am so excited that Colton is the bachelor. Oh, my gosh. I am so nervous to meet him actually. [laughs] My greatest hope is that when I meet Colton, we really click, and hit it off, and I leave with him.
HANNAHB: Hi, I'm Hannah. Welcome to Alabama! I grew up in Titletown, home of the champions. I love Tuscaloosa, proud to be an Alabama fan. Roll tide! I'm miss Alabama, which makes me a queen here. Getting to serve my great state, that was truly a dream come true. It's fun. I have my own autograph pads. I always like to leave an encouraging message. Yeah, but I'm a total train wreck. I just am hoping that Colton will like the good, bad, and hot mess. The hot mess express and I'm the conductor.
HANNAHB [in exclamation]: C‐o‐l‐t‐o‐n, Colton, Colton, you're a ten!
HANNAHB: So I've only kissed four guys that were my boyfriends. I am not a virgin, but sex a big deal so Colton is the bachelor and that he is a virgin is super appealing to me. I honestly couldn't believe people were like, "what?" I was like, oh, my God, it's so awesome. Like, it is so amazing. But then I am like, "how?". Colton, I hope you are ready for Alabama Hannah because Alabama Hannah is ready for you.
[laughs]
KATIE: Hi, my name is katie, 26 years old and I am from the east coast. I came to L.A. because I wanted to dance. I love dancing. And as much as I love creative freedom and the arts, I'm a person who wants stability and security. The kind of love I hope to have one day is like my parents. They have been married for 30 years. They are inseparable. I love that. I want that. I am really excited to meet Colton because he has blonde hair, green eyes, athletic, super kind, kind of weird. I seem to have a very specific type. If he ends up liking the person I am and I end up loving the person he is, then 100%, I could be engaged at the end of this. 
HEATHER: Hi I'm Heather, I'm 22, and I was born and raised in California. If I'm not working, I am at the beach. I'm a beach girl through and through. I paddleboard, I am always in the water, always at the beach. But here's the thing, I hae never had sex before and I've never kissed anyone. "Hey, I'm heather, I've never kissed anyone," that is really not my opening typically. [laughs] I met Colton at his charity event in San Diego for 15 seconds. Took quick pictures, and is like, okay, I like that guy. Colton seems to have all the qualities that I'm looking for in a future husband. I could definitely see myself having my first kiss with Colton.
ONYEKA: Hi, my name is Onyeka E. I am 24 years old and I live in Dallas, Texas. I grew up in a strong, traditional Nigerian family. My full name could not fit in the thing that they put down here. I am not afraid to embarras myself. Anyone who knows me knows I will do the weirdest thingn public. I'm loud and obnoxious at times. I do not care what people think about me. I think I'm a lot to handle. [laughs] but I also have a really bg heart that comes with that. My parents are from Nigeria. They dated for two weeks and then they were engaged. I'm a firm believer in when you know, you know. Colton, he has all the morals, and all the characters I look for in a guy. And he's hot. If I was the person that Colton can gave his virginity to, I would definitely bring out all the tricks. [laughs]
NICOLE: Hola, me llamo Nicole y bienvenido a Miami. Being single when you are relatively attractive, it's hard because there are so many singles in Miami. So when I go out, you're not going to meet eligible bachelors. They're part of that hookup culture. I'm not about that. I'm looking for the real deal. My life in Miami is totally focused and centered on my family. My brother, A. J., suffers from autism. He is part of the package deal. He is going to be with me always. My mom and my grandma, my brother, are, like, my world. I'm so excited to meet Colton. I could just tell he would be so welcoming to, like, to my family and to my life.
KIRPA: Hi, my name is Kirpa. I'm a dental hygienist from Whittier, California. I really hope that Colton flosses, because being a dental hygienist, that is one of the first things I tend to gravitate to. It would be a good experienve to clean Colton's teeth. With Colton, that's as close as you can get right now, so I'll take it. [laughs] I am blessed to have a fantastic family, a loving family from different backgrounds that loves each other. And puts up with one another. The only thing that has been missing is someone to share that with. The end of this, if it coud lead to an engagement, that would be amazing. Fingers crossed. [laughs]
DEMI: Hi, I'm Demi Burnett, 23 years old, and I'm hot doggin' for Colton. Vroom vroom! My friends and family would describe me as super bubbly and outgoing, a little sassy, country girl. I don't mind getting my has dirty and having fun. I've never had a serious relationship. I live with my dad and my stepmom. My dad always had the proper environment for us and so we've always been with him. My mom, she had to go to federal prison. She's there because of embezzlement. My mom is actually gonna get out very soon and the next time that I would potentiay see her would be with Colton. I'm really excited for Colton. I know that he's a virgin, it is kind of concerning. If you only ever have a vanilla cupcake, well, how do you know you don't like chocolate? How do you know you don't like strawberry? I feel like you got to try all the cupcakes first to know what you want. [laughs] I am the damn confetti cake. [laughs]
COLTON: I'm Colton Underwood. I'm 26 and I never expected to be the next bachelor. I know not everybody's going to like me. I know I have a lot of room grow, but I also have an idea of what I want now. And that is what is so exciting about all this. I am the first virgin bachelor and it's crazy to even think about that. This is an opportunity of a lifetime, and I couldn't be more hopeful and excited. But then I also feel real nervous. Grade school Colton probaby would be really shy and timid, the fact that he was just named the bachelor. I grew up in a pretty conservative environment. I was at a Christian school I was always, like, the fat, chunky, awkward, weird kid. I didn't have girlfriends. I wanted to fit in so bad, but I felt very alone. A lot of days, I didn't want to go to school. My confidence in myself didn't come until my later years in high school. The one thing I knew how to do really well was football. When things were good, it was because of football. And that is why I got lost in it. I made it to the NFL. And for me, it was so special. I've had such a great life. I've had so many cool opportunities but the one thing I've been missing is somebody to share those with. I do know what love is. I mean, I've been in love before. And I remember how good I felt in those relationships. Falling in love with Becca was very eye‐opening. The comfort level was there chemistry was there. I was so open, I was so vulnerable. I was ready to really the next step. I was ready to lose my virginity to Becca. I was devastated when that relationship ended. And as tough and as challenging as that was, everything that has happened over the last year has been so transformative and so good for me. It's just the perfect time for me to focus on finding the person who I'm going to be spending the rest of my life with. I'm here to fall in love, and I'm here because I know how real it was when I was on the other side.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: What's it like being announced the bachelor?
COLTON [to CHRIS]: For me, it was a little bit unexpected but it was something I was so grateful for, just the opportunity that I now knom going to have in front of me.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: You weren't expecting it? You were a controversial choice.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: Yeah, I would be lying if I said I didn't look at any of the negative reactions.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: Of course.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: Some of the comments, I could see where they come I get it. They think I'm not ready. And it's a fine balance because I'm not here to do it for the fans or do it to win people over. I'm doing this for me. 
CHRIS [to COLTON]: How much of the negativity and "he's not ready" do you think has to do with your virginity?
COLTON [to CHRIS]: That ‐‐ that's sort of thee stigma around being a virgin. Oh, he's not romantic, oh, he's not going to be a good bachelor.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: That he's not a man.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: Yeah. And that got thrown at me this year. That was the thing, for the first time in my life, what I feared people might say to me actually got said to me. I mean, it is one of those things, I'm not waiting for a ring. I'm not waiting for marriage. I'm waiting to be in love. I'm waiting for it to feel right, to take our relationship to the next step. 
CHRIS [to COLTON]: You are about to have women from all over the country coming here just to meet you. Do you believe in love at first sight? Do you think you will see a girl tonight and go, "that's the one?"
COLTON [to CHRIS]: I thought about that.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: It's cool to think about.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: It is very cool to think about. But then, part of me, I don't want that because I just want to treat every relationship differently.
COLTON: Being back here at the mansion reminds me that this works. This is real. And I am so humble and I ao grateful for this opportunity, but I am also so hopeful. This is my time. I am diving headfirst, and I'm going. And I can't wait to get started.
KIRPA: I'm ready to find love, and I'm very excited to meet Colton.
CASSIE: I am so excited that Colton is the bachelor. I think a ring would look pretty good on this finger, so...
[laughs]
HEATHER [to WOMEN]: Cheers to tonight, ladies!
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Yay!

COLTON [to CHRIS]: Thank you. You do, too.
JANE [to WOMEN]: I was hoping for Colton.
??? [to WOMEN]: Yeah, he's the best.
HANNAHB: I don't think there could have been a more perfect bachelor for me. We would have really cute dimple babies.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: The athlete in me wants to have a gameplan, I want to have a strategy, but I just want be present. I want to be living in the moment, I want to have fun with this.
??? [to WOMEN]: You know he's going to be nervous, and you're a litte nervous.
??? [to WOMEN]: Is he more nervous than?
??? [to WOMEN]: Yes, absolutely.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: I remember my walkup still.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: What did you say to Becca?
COLTON [to CHRIS]: I still don't remember I said. I blacked out for that moment. I just remember how incredible that feeling was walking in there for the first time.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: My heart is pounding so! This is happening, oh, y God.
ELYSE [to WOMEN]: This is insane.
[contestants exclaim]
CHRIS [to COLTON]: All right, man. This is it.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: Pregame jitters. I'm ready to go.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: I hope you are ready to go because the first limo is pulling up the driveway right now. Colton, good luck.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: Thank you.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: Let the journey begin.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Oh, my God! he looks so cute! He's going to be blushing whole night. [laughter] I could die right here, right now. [contestants exclaim "Colton"]

COLTON [to COURTNEY]: I'll save it for later?
NICOLE: I feel like I would never have brought up his virginity right away because it is to personal. Like, "Hi, I'm Nicole, I hear you're a virgin." That's cool. Yeah, I would never do that.
KATIE [to COLTON]: You are going to think of what the card is. Don't look.
COLTON [to KATIE]: Yes.
KATIE [to COLTON]: I don't know what card you were thinking, but I think I just took your V-card.
[laughter]
CAITLIN: Already I feel like you can kind of tell who mighta little bit feistier than others. But I don't know what Colton's type is. Maybe he likes a girl who's little bit slower.
COLTON [to ALEXD]: It's a sloth.
ALEXD [to COLTON]: Hi...
COLTON [to ALEXD]: How's it going?

NICOLE: I'm taking it so serious, oh, my God, how does my dress look? And then a sloth comes in. Like, what's up?
DEMI [to ALEXD]: I admire your bravery.

COLTON [to ANGELIQUE]: That's okay.
NICOLE: Like, I had no idea, I didn't get the debutante, miss America memo.

NICOLE: I'm surrounded by so may beautiful girls tonight. In my eyes, I'm like, oh, my God, forget it. He's not going to notice me. So I thought when I was speaking Spanish, that was kind of a crazy thing. Hopefully I'll stand out.
REVIAN [to COLTON]: So I just want to tell you [speaking Mandarin] Which is Mandarin for "I think you're a stud muffin"
COLTON [to REVIAN]: Thank you. I don't know a lot of Mandarin.

CATHERINE [to COLTON]: So nice to meet you. This is my 10‐year‐old daughter, Lucy.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Nice. Hi, Lucy, how are you?
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: I thought since you are laying your heart on the line, it was only fair to give you a piece of mine. So I'm going to give you her during this journey.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Yes. Oh, she's not liking me.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: It's okay. You have to win her over, too.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Okay. You'll see here inside.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Take care of her.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: I will. Wave goodbye. "bye."
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: You look good together.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Thank you!
CATHERINE: Everyone does like dogs, of course, and Lucy is just a special little animal. Maybe that was love at first sight.
CATHERINE [to WOMEN]: She's going to be living with Colton.
WOMEN [to CATHERINE]: Your dog? Your actual dog?
CATHERINE [to WOMEN]: What's a better way to get to know me than through my child?
TRACY: She's giving away her dog to Colton already, really setting this whole thing up.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: Would you like me to dog sit for you? Oh, look, I think she likes you. She slobbered on you.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: That's okay.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: Pull yourself together.
ONYEKA [to TRACY]: Maybe I'll give Colton a picture of my dog and be like, here's my dog, he's way better. He's an aussiedoodle. His name is Smokey.
TRACY [to ONYEKA]: An aussiedoodle? My parents have two miniate poodles and one pomapoo.
ONYEKA: Honestly, I'm a little jealous that Catherine brought her dog.
ONYEKA [to TRACY]: She brought her dog. I'm just ‐‐ it's fine.
ONYEKA: I do think that puts het an unfair advantage, so I'm going to go ahead and say this is the craziest way to start night.
CATHERINE [to WOMEN]: I hope he's worth it, you know? I feel like she's a piece my heart.
??? [in exclamation]: Oh, my God. She has a horse and carriage. Y'all.

COLTON [to CHRIS]: Still a little nervous. I mean, look at all of the beautiful women in there. I mean, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: What stood out to you the most?
COLTON [to CHRIS]: I would say, all of thee so confident, and that is f the most attractive thingst I could find in somebody am so excited to get this thing started.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: One thing you should know, and something you are familiar with, first impression rose. Obviously, give that to the woman that you have a connection with, just that one woman you definitely want to keep around.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: Are you ready to go?
COLTON [to CHRIS]: Yeah.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: All right, brother.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: Awesome.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: Good luck. Colton, the house is yours.
ERIN [to WOMEN]: I was a little bit skeptical coming into this. I was like, is he really ready? I am. That's the reason I'm here. So I'm hoping that ‐‐
TAHZJUAN [to WOMEN]: It's reciprocated.
ERIN [to WOMEN]: Right, exactly.
HANNAHG [to WOMEN]: I am just ready to talk to him.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: This is so exciting! This is crazy. [contestants exclaim] Wow! Oh, my God. Hi. This is for you.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Thank you, thank you. You all are stunning tonight. And any expectations that I had, how that was going to go, you guys blew it away. [laughter] so I am so excited to start this journey with all of you. While I know a lot of different emotions are probably running through your head right now, and it could be daunting at times, it's so worth it. I fell in love with Becca, and while that didn't work out I was so grateful for that heartbreak, because it led me here to you tonight. And I know there has been people who said that I might not be ready for this. Well, I'm here, standing in front of all of you, to let you know I am so excited, I am so ready for all of this. And one thing that I promise you is that I am going to stay true to myself, I'm going to be open and honest, and that is all that I am asking from you guys in return, is openness and honesty. I'm very hopeful that standing in this room tonight is my wife. And that is so exciting to even say. [contestants exclaim] so let's get this thing started! Let's make a toast to new beginnings, to taking chances, and to falling in love. Cheers.

DEMI [to COLTON]: Good. Do you remember my name?
COLTON [to DEMI]: Demi.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Yeah, you got it.
CAELYNN [to WOMEN]: I'm like, what just happened?
CAELYNN: I did not expect it to be so intense right off the bat. I mean, as soon as Demi took him, the mood shifted and we were all like "woah".
CASSIE [to CAELYNN]: Demi was, like, on it.
CAELYNN [to CASSIE]: Dang.
DEMI [to COLTON]: So tell me a little bit about you. I don't really know much. Like, where are you from?
COLTON [to DEMI]: I'm from Colorado. I grew up, I have a great family, awesome dogs.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Oh, you got dogs? What kind of dogs?
COLTON [to DEMI]: Do you have dogs?
DEMI [to COLTON]: I have kitty cats but I like dogs.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Okay.
DEMI [to COLTON]: I love all kinds of animals.
COLTON [to DEMI]: I got you, I got you. Where are you from?
DEMI [to COLTON]: I'm from texas.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Texas. What part?
DEMI [to COLTON]: Texas girl. Around Dallas.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Okay.
DEMI [to COLTON]: So I work in Dallas but I live in, like, the country, so I kind of have an equal balance of both. I like four wheeling, I like long boarding, I like doing anything fun like that.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Okay. So you're not afraid to get dirty?
DEMI [to COLTON]: Oh, no. Definitely not. I know I look so pretty but
COLTON [to DEMI]: You have very pretty eyes, too.
DEMI [to COLTON]: You are so cute.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Thanks, you, too. You are looking good.
DEMI [to COLTON]: Oh, thank you.
DEMI: I definitely feel like Colton's attracted to me. I could tell by the way he complimented my eyes and my dress. I could see it in his eyes that he's got got a little crush on me.
DEMI [to COLTON]: You are a total stud and very excited to get to be here with you.
COLTON [to DEMI]: Thanks.
ERIKA [to WOMEN]: I just want to know why he's a virgin. Like, are you saving it for marriage? Like, what's going on?
??? [to ERIKA]: Would it have bothered you whether he answered a certain way?
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: At least he's a cute virgin.
ERIKA [to WOMEN]: Yeah, but he is so cute. This is so weird because you're so attractive.
[laughs]
ERIKA: That's just so weird. Like that just doesn't happen nowadays.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: It's nice to finally talk to you.
ERIKA: For me, personally, sex in a relationship is very important, and Colton is a very handsome guy. It was definitely lust at first sight, so I want to hear from him. Why?
ERIKA [to COLTON]: So fun night.
COLTON [to ERIKA]: Yeah.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: This is a lot for you, I'm sure. Do you remember my name?
COLTON [to ERIKA]: No. Help me out.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: The nuts.
COLTON [to ERIKA]: Oh, McNutt.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: McNutt! yes.
COLTON [to ERIKA]: That's not your name. Your last name.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: But, like, I am McNutt. Yeah, Erika.
COLTON [to ERIKA]: Erika.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: Erika McNutt, yeah. See, the nuts work. So I'm just going to straight up ask this.
COLTON [to ERIKA]: Yes.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: Everyone knows you're a virgin. So I want to know why.
COLTON [to ERIKA]: For me, growing up, it s sort of a conscious decision at first. And then I started really diving deep into my professional career, and my personal life took a backseat.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: Okay.
COLTON [to ERIKA]: And now that it's happened, I'm not just going to randomly lose it on a one night sta. It's not like I'm waiting for marriage, I'm waiting for the right person. I'm waiting for the right moment.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: Okay, okay.
COLTON [to ERIKA]: Which is very important to me. And I hold a lot of value a lot of stock into it.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: It's special. You should keep it special.
COLTON [to ERIKA]: For sure.
ERIKA [to COLTON]: You know?
COLTON [to ERIKA]: For sure.
COLTON: My first night as the bachelor is so surreal.
KIRPA [to COLTON]: Your speech earlier was really, like, I think it just calmed everyone down. Like ‐‐
COLTON [to KIRPA]: I wish it would've calmed me down a little bit. I was a little nervous.
COLTON: There are 30 women here and they are all absolutely gorgeous. I am bouncing from conversation to conversation and trying to keep up with them.
COLTON [to LAURA]: Laura, right?
LAURA [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to LAURA]: Laura?
LAURA [to COLTON]: Yeah.
COLTON [to LAURA]: I'm working on it.
LAURA [to COLTON]: I can't even imagine how you are doing it.
COLTON [to LAURA]: I'm trying. I'm trying my hardest.
COLTON: I've never been in a situation like this before.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: How was your night goin?
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Good. It's ‐‐ little bit nervous.
[laughter]
COLTON: I'm dating six times the amount of women that I've dated in my whole entire life in one night. So I'm a little overwhelmey all of this.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Okay, so I was wonderin. You used to do football and stuff.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Yes.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Was it more nerve‐racking hearing that you were going to be the bachelor or, like, playing NFL football games?
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: It was actually really similar. It's actually the pregame jitters, all the anticipation to, like, start it off.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Yeah, I almost died getting out of the limo. I almost died.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: You didn't look nervous, though. You killed it. You really did.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: You had so many people. I was like, I'm not going to even be able to, like, stand out at all.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: No, but yours definitely stood out.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Okay, okay. That was my biggest fear coming into this because I'm not usually somebody who is tht
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Well, you are doing a gd job. You really are.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Okay, well, my heart is beating out of my chest.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Here. Here's what me and my mom do. When we are nervous, we take three deep breaths. Are you ready? One, two, three. One.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Okay, that was good.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Two.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Okay.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Three.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Okay.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Is your heart beating a little slower?
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Actually, yes. I swear, it actually is. You are so cute. You are so cute.
HANNAHG: Before I talked to Colton I was really nervous, and I d tell he was, too. But he just made me feel so comfortable.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Awesome chatting with you.
HANNAHG: Colton is definitely somebody I could fall for. So I'm excited.
JANE [to WOMEN]: Has Colton kissed anyone tonight?
ANGELIQUE [to WOMEN]: I mean, I'm sure every girl here wants to.
??? [to WOMEN]: I guess it would depend on that person's conversation.
??? [to WOMEN]: And how he's feeling.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: It's been good. How's yours?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Super awesome.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: So you said Miss Carolina, right?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: North Carolina. Yeah.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: Is that where you consider home?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: I'm from Virginia originally but I moved to North Carolina about a year ago. I love North Carolina. But I love to travel more than anything.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: So where's your favorite place you've been?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: I love Phuket, Thailand. I got dumped in Thailand, though. So, bittersweet.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: I got dumped before Thailand so we have something sort of in common.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: [laughs] That's great. I love to travel. I'm at this point in my life where I am young and my goal is to eventually get married and so that's why I'm here.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: How old are you?
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: I'm 23.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: 23.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Yeah, I know that is young but I have gone through so much that it's aged me, so I'm more than ready for marriage.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: My parents had me when they were 24. That's how I am, too. Everyone is like, you are so young at 26, I am like ‐‐
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: People are critical.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: My mom had me when she was 24, and I am sort of the same way, my life experience has made me more of a man than most 30‐year‐olds.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: That's exactly how I feel. Yes, absolutely.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: We can relate on that.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: Yeah.
JANE [to WOMEN]: There is no way this night is going to end and, like, no one has kissed Colton.
ERIN [to WOMEN]: I think that he needs to make that move because he's slower.
JANE [to WOMEN]: Can you imagine if, like he made that move? That would be be pretty crazy.
ERIN [to WOMEN]: Yeah, that's big.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: You have beautiful eyes!
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: So do you! I am like, wow. I'm just like drawn.
CAELYNN: He kisses very well for a virgin. [laughs] I was shocked at how he just took the initiative and like drew in and I was like, wow. He's ‐‐ yeah. I was about it.
CAELYNN [to COLTON]: It was good talking to you.
COLTON [to CAELYNN]: It was very nice talking with you, too.
CAELYNN: So I hope I made a good impression on him.
[contestants exclaim]

COURTNEY: The first impression rose goes down on the table, and I can just feel the mood in the room getting more and more intense.

ANGELIQUE [to WOMEN]: Brace yourself, ladies.
TAHZJUAN: Everyone wants to get the first impression rose. So claws are about to come out, 100%.
TRACY [to WOMEN]: I want that rose.

ANGELIQUE: First impression rose came out and everybody was like [gasp]. We all feel stressed out, a little tense, especially the ones who haven't had any time with him yet.
HANNAHB [to WOMEN]: I just need to talk to him. Like, all right, where you at?
??? [to WOMEN]: Where is he? Do you hear music?
SYDNEY [to COURTNEY]: So I did tell you that a dancer and that I did leave my job, but I found that I don't necessarily have to give up dancing. I can still have both. So I can teach you a little something. Yeah, this is my string quartet.
COLTON [to SYDNEY]: I love learning. You know I'm a terrible dancer, right?
SYDNEY [to COLTON]: Right. I saw a little bit of that don't worry, that is what I'm here for. Then you are going to step. So technically, you would, yeah. So follow me. Step out, and then back and then repeat.
COLTON [to SYDNEY]: So it's in a square?
SYDNEY [to COLTON]: In a square, right.

SYDNEY [to COLTON]: And then the dramatic.
COLTON [to SYDNEY]: The dramatic dip.
SYDNEY [to COLTON]: That feels so good.
??? [to WOMEN]: Oh, my God. He's falling in love right now.
SYDNEY [in exclamation]: Oh!
HEATHER: It's not fun to see Colton connecting and dancing with another girl. It's no fun at all
COLTON [to SYDNEY]: I feel like I need to spin. I feel like I'm a professional dancer now, sort of.
SYDNEY [to COLTON]: I'm looking for a lifelong dance partner.
COLTON [to SYDNEY]: Oh, nice.
SYDNEY [to COLTON]: I feel like you fit that role.
COLTON [to SYDNEY]: That's a good thing.
CASSIE: Watching them made me very jealous. Tonight has already started being a big show‐off fest. Like, how do you make a really good impression, how do you get his attention?
ELYSE [to COLTON]: I'm from Alaska, and you can't go to Alaska without knowing how to fish. So we are fishing.
COLTON [to ELYSE]: Here we go. Oh, she's giving me a good fight. She's giving me a really good fight. Get it, get it while it's there.

ERIKA [to WOMEN]: She is not in the tree. No. Oh, my God.
[laughs]
HANNAHB [to WOMEN]: The sloth is kind of weird but I bet she's nice.
TRACY: I just want to know what she looks like. Like, who is this person?

ALEXD [to COLTON]: Thank you. Sincerely, thank you.
COLTON [to ALEXD]: You nailed it. So tell me about yourself.
ALEXD [to COLTON]: So my name is Alex. I am from Cape Cod. So I have a mom, dad, they've been together forever, older brother, smartest, best guy in the entire world. I love my city, I love Boston love my family, I love my job I love it so much, I'm an account manager.
ALEXB [to WOMEN]: She speaks very, very fast for a sloth.
??? [to WOMEN]: For a sloth. She talks so fast.
ALEXD [to COLTON]: I love animals, I know you love dogs. Colton, you know what, I love cats, too. I love all animals. All animals.
COLTON [to ALEXD]: Me too.
COLTON [to ALEXD]: Yeah? Really?
COLTON [to ALEXD]: The sloth is, behind dogs, one of my favorite animals.
COLTON [to ALEXD]: Why?
COLTON [to ALEXD]: Look, how can you not like a sloth?
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: I think the first impression rose will go to the person that he hasn't been able to get out of his head. And the person he's been thinking about all night.
NINA [to WOMEN]: The person he's most excited about.
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: So honestly ‐‐
NINA [to WOMEN]: It's a big deal.
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: Yeah.
CATHERINE [to WOMEN]: I'm going to exit on that note.
CATHERINE: I personally don't feel like there's competition. These girls, they are just, like, beautiful statues. There's not much substance to them. So I am confident I will make the best impression on him.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Hi.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: How are you?
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: I'm amazing.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Chris is doing a good job of watching after your dog.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: [laughs]
CHRIS [to DOG]: Come on, Lucy. Come on. Do your business. Come on.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: What do you think about Lucy?
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: She really ‐‐ you could tell that she really loves you.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: You know, I'm putting her in your hands, and I hope that you're worth it.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Well, you can always tell if a dog doesn't like somebody, that is a little bit of a red flag.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Yeah, you have to win us both over. It's not just her.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: It's a household of two.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Yeah, absolutely.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Where are you from?
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Fort Lauderdale. So we did the boats and the beaches and the wakeboarding, and fishing. I love a good adventure.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: I like that.
TRACY [to COLTON]: Hi. Mind if I borrow you? Maybe arrest you?
[laughs]
COLTON [to TRACY]: Yeah, for sure.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: I'll come talk to you later.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: It was nice chatting wih you.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Yes, of course.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: See you later.
TRACY [to COLTON]: All right.
COLTON [to TRACY]: Hi.
TRACY [to COLTON]: So nice to see you.
COLTON [to TRACY]: Where are we going?
TRACY [to COLTON]: Down here.
COLTON [to TRACY]: All right.
CATHERINE [to SELF]: That was so quick. What the hell?
CATHERINE: My conversation with Colton was very short. We were interrupted.
COLTON [to TRACY]: Look at these.
TRACY [to COLTON]: I thought we could drawn on them together and make little "bachelor" shoes.
CATHERINE: I've never had to fight for somebody's attention before, you know, I go after what I want, and I am drawn to Colton. I think this is our moment to connect and ideally fall in love, create this whole entire amazing lifestyle together and so we need to spend a little bit more than a couple minutes with each other.
CATHERINE [to TRACY]: Excuse me, I'm so sorry to interrupt. We just only had a few minutes earlier and I just want to talk to you a little more.
TRACY [to CATHERINE]: Can we color for a few more minutes and then I'll pass him along to you?
CATHERINE [to TRACY]: I'm sorry. I just really think we need to finish our conversation.
TRACY [to CATHERINE]: Okay.
CATHERINE [to TRACY]: All right.
??? [to WOMEN]: Is that a girl that already talked to him?
ONYEKA [in exclamation]: Oh, my God.
ERIN [to WOMEN]: Already?
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: She literally just talked to him.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Want to go back up there?
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Sure. I didn't mean to interrupt your coloring but I think our conversation might be a little more important.
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: Seriously?
ONYEKA: I think Catherine is being very disrespectful to everyone in the house right now because everyone is trying to have their first impression with him, a lot of people haven't talked to him at all, and so I feel like Catherine deserves a taste of her own medicine.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: We got interrupted way too soon and I just wanted to hear more about you.
ONYEKA [to COLTON]: [whistle blowing] Colton, I heard you were drowning in some bitches, I came to save you!
??? [in exclamation]: Oh, my gosh.
??? [to WOMEN]: Did she say bitches?
TRACY [to WOMEN]: I think she said it.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Hopefully we'll have some more time later. It's been very short. But enjoy your time together.
ONYEKA [to COLTON]: Thank you. How are you doing?
COLTON [to ONYEKA]: Good, how are you?
ONYEKA [to COLTON]: How do you like my snorkel?
COLTON [to ONYEKA]: I love it.
CATHERINE: Ideally, in the ocean, looking at a beautiful reef is probably why I would be wearing a snorkel. Other than that, I probably wouldn't put a snorkel on. I think it was just a litte tacky.
COLTON [to ONYEKA]: I really appreciate ‐‐
ONYEKA [to COLTON]: So great talking to you.
COLTON [to ONYEKA]: You coming in with a snorkel.
ONYEKA [to COLTON]: Yes, and also, I am CPR certified. If you want to practice mouth‐to‐mouth resuscitation, you know where to find me.
COLTON [to ONYEKA]: All right. Sounds good.
ONYEKA [to COLTON]: All right, sounds good.
CATHERINE: I don't know if she was trying to intimidate me or if she was trying to get me off my game, but I'm not going to let it faze me. I'm here to get to know Colton. He's my priority and if I want to talk to him again, I'm going to talk to him again.
CATHERINE [to CAITLIN]: Excuse me.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Hi.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Hi, again.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: How are you?
CATHERINE [to CAITLIN]: Do you mind if I interrupt?
CAITLIN [to COLTON]: Um, sure.
COLTON [to CAITLIN]: All right. Give you a hug.
CAITLIN [to COLTON]: Okay.
COLTON [to CAITLIN]: I'll see you soon, all right?
CAITLIN [to COLTON]: Yes.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Third time's a charm, huh?
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: I think so. Good to see you again.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Are we going to go to or spot up here?
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: We can chill here, it's fine.
DEMI [to CAITLIN]: Have you had a good night? Did you have a good talk with him?
CAITLIN [to WOMEN]: Yeah, yeah. It was nice. And then Catherine cut in.
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: She stole him again?
CAITLIN [to WOMEN]: He was like, "third time's a charm."
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: He said that?
CAELYNN: I think it was frustrating for all of us to hear, we were all, like, "wait, what?"
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: I would not feel comfortable stealing him for a second time right now, because I have respect for the other girl that haven't talked to him yet.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: It disadvantages everybody else that is here.
HEATHER: No one right now is happy with Catherine's aggressiveness because a lot of girls still haven't gotten their time with him yet.
CATHERINE [to WOMEN]: Hi.
ONYEKA: This is complete *bleep*, what Catherine is doing. Like, honestly, like, girl, stop with this *bleep*.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: Catherine, can I steal you for a second real quick?
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: Sure.
NICOLE [to WOMEN]: Oh, my God, the drama already.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: Just want to, like, get some fresh air and chat a little bit.
??? [to WOMEN]: Wait, those two are talking?
??? [to WOMEN]: Do you think that they'e having a confrontation?
??? [to WOMEN]: I absolutely do.
ALEXB [to WOMEN]: *bleep*. It's getting real.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: How do you feel like your time with Colton was?
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: Too short.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: Yeah. So I'm kind of catching wind from other girls, and just because you have stolen Colton three times already, it's definitely rubbing people people wrong way. I think it is almost a little desperate and I don't know if you haven't had, like, good conversations with him, but I think it's important that you let other girls take time with him.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: I'm sorry if I stepped on their toes and I'm sorry if I insulted anyone or was too aggressive or I looked "desperate," which is hilarious, by the way. But you know what I mean? He's my priority.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: Colton is everyone's priority. I'm just saying, like, respect everyone.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: I don't think that I hae disrespected anybody. My time with him was very short. I spoke with him probably 30 seconds the first time, maybe, like ‐‐
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: It wasn't 30 seconds.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: I know you think it was longer but it really wasn't longer than, like, 30 seconds or a minute.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: Okay.
[laughs]
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: Don't laugh like that.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: No, I mean, I know I took him from you and I waited a long time to make sure you, like, plenty of time to talk to him before I went and stole him.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: I don't want to argue wh you. I am, like, the least argumentative person.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: Yeah, no, definitely.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: I do not want any bad blood at all.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: You don't want bad blood honestly, I am looking out for you at this point.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: I get that, that is why I understand that people are upset that I talked to him a couple times and some people haven't.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: I'm here to keep it real with you, with Colton, with everyone here.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: Cheers to that. Keeping it real.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: Cheers to that. Honestly, I feel good about this conversation. I hope you do. I hope you know where ‐‐ how people feel.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: If you don't have haters, you're not doing something right.
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: Yeah. Haters.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: [laughs]
ONYEKA [to CATHERINE]: Yep.
ONYEKA: I feel like the conversation went well.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: That was a good chat.
ONYEKA: Even though she was a little defensive, I think I got through to her, and she won't be stealing Colton again.
CATHERINE [to ONYEKA]: Thanks for letting me know.
??? [to WOMEN]: There is a hug.
??? [to WOMEN]: Hug it out.
TAHZJUAN [to COLTON]: So I got something for you.
COLTON [to TAHZJUAN]: "find the silver lining"
TAHZJUAN [to COLTON]: 'cause it's really, really hard to be in this situation, having to make those really hard decisions ‐‐
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Excuse me. Hi. Can I have another few moments with you?
TAHZJUAN [to CATHERINE]: Oh. Um, okay.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Good.
TAHZJUAN [to COLTON]: Thank you.
COLTON [to TAHZJUAN]: Yeah, thank you.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Hi, again.
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: How are you?
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Amazing. How are you doing?
COLTON [to CATHERINE]: Fourth time's a charm.
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: It is.
TAHZJUAN: As I was walking away, Colton n was like, "oh, fourth time's the charm." and I was like, yeah, really? Really?
TAHZJUAN [to WOMEN]: So I was just talking to Colton.
??? [to WOMEN]: Yay! Okay. You go, girl.
TAHZJUAN [to WOMEN]: So that was great but I got interrupted ‐‐
??? [to TAHZJUAN]: By who?
TAHZJUAN [to WOMEN]: What's her name? The one who brought the dog?
??? [in exclamation]: Wait, wait, wait ‐‐
ONYEKA [to TAHZJUAN]: Catherine interrupted you?
TAHZJUAN [to WOMEN]: I walked away and he said, "fourth time's the charm."
ONYEKA [to TAHZJUAN]: Four times? 
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: That's unheard of.
ONYEKA [to TAHZJUAN]: I think everyone should get a chance to have time to talk to him. Everyone. So ‐‐ and I told her that.
ONYEKA: What the hell? I can't believe she stole Colton again. I thought we had a great conversation. We hugged it out afterwards everything. But obviously she doesn't care at all.
TAHZJUAN [to WOMEN]: At the same time, it's a little excessive, for sure.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: Not even a little excessive. Actually excessive.
COURTNEY: It's really frustrating because I've been waiting patiently and being respectful to all the other girls to get my time and Catherine is being straight up rude.
COURTNEY [to WOMEN]: How is it possible that someone could interrupt so many times and there are so many people who haven't had time?
SYDNEY: A lot of girls haven't had time to talk to him yet. So they are starting to panic.
??? [to WOMEN]: Oh, my gosh. So nerve‐racking.
SYDNEY: Because you don't get time, you're probably going home.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: So tell me a little bit about yourself.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: So, yeah. I live in Huntington Beach.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Awesome.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: Yes. So I know a little bit of sign language. I use it a lot for work. So I thought I could teach you a few things.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Yeah, I'd really like that.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: [laughs] the first thing I was going to teach you.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Goatee?
CASSIE [to COLTON]: No, not a goatee. But I like your scruff. It is, "you are cute."
COLTON [to CASSIE]: What else you got?
CASSIE [to COLTON]: This is pretty fitting.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Rose. I can teach you "kiss" too, though.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: What is "kiss?" so, that is "kiss?"
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Put it on your mouth.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: You don't have to put your hand back. You can have them, like, together.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: Sorry. We are learning here, all right? So it would just be like that.
CASSIE [to COLTON]: You are doing good.
COLTON [to CASSIE]: I'm picking up what you're putting down. I got it.
COLTON: I can definitely say that I'm very smitten by some of the women here tonight. They are super sexy. And I already feel the spark right off the bat with a few of them.
KATIE [to COLTON]: So I am super close to my family. Are you?
COLTON [to KATIE]: Yes.
KATIE [to COLTON]: Okay, good. That is a really big part my values.
COLTON [to KATIE]: I like that, I like that. My immediate family is in Colorado and a lot of like my grandma, my aunts, my uncles, everybody, all my cousins are back in Illinois still.
KATIE [to COLTON]: Oh, okay.
COLTON [to KATIE]: I grew up with a lot of strong, independent women in my life.
KATIE [to COLTON]: I am really big on that.
COLTON [to KATIE]: Oh, yeah. That is sort of what has le to know that's what I need and that's what I want.
KATIE [to COLTON]: Good.
COLTON [to KATIE]: I want somebody who knows what they want and they art afraid to say it.
KATIE [to COLTON]: Good. I do definitely believe what you say about independent women and I definitely believe in having our own things separate and then having our thing together.
COLTON [to KATIE]: Yep. Yeah. You have to have that balance. Life is all about balance. You have to have your own life.
KATIE [to COLTON]: Yeah.
KATIE [to COLTON]: But that is sort of what falling and being in love s like, you are sharing your, your passions with somebody else.
KATIE [to COLTON]: I wanted to let you know I'm really excited that it is you.
KATIE [to COLTON]: Well, I am happy you are too. That means the world to me.
KATIE [to COLTON]: Of course. It's going to be worth it.
KATIE [to COLTON]: [laughs]
KATIE [to COLTON]: I'm so excited that you're here.
KATIE: I never expected to get kissed on the first night. But it was really good. I feel like we have a good connection. So I am excited.
KATIE [to COLTON]: I have a really good feg about this whole thing.
COLTON [to KATIE]: Me too.
DEVIN: It is pretty nerve‐racko not have time with him.
DEVIN [to ONYEKA]: I'm just like worried as point. That I'm going to go home.
ANGELIQUE: It's getting really late and a lot of women still havent talked to him yet.
??? [to ???]: Did you get your time?
??? [to ???]: I honestly don't know if we're going to.
ANGELIQUE: Girls are freaking out.
ERIN [to WOMEN]: I'm really stressed.
ANGELIQUE: Erin is freaking out rit now. She's walking around with e shoe. So ‐‐ that's one reason to freak out on its own. With one frickin' shoe.
ONYEKA [to WOMEN]: I'd be freaking out if I didn't have time with him tonight.
HANNAHB [to WOMEN]: You know, I'm trying toe patient because there is at of us. But... Kind of freaking out too.
HANNAHB: The first impression ros is out there. I'm sure he has already hae really good conversations. Of course, they are so many great girls. What if he was already like, hey, that was awesome? And then he hasn't talked to me yet. And I'm like, I might've been really cool too.
ALEXB [to COLTON]: I ran a dog rescue in Vancouver.
COLTON [to ALEXB]: That's awesome.
ALEXB [to COLTON]: My sister and I run it together.
COLTON [to ALEXB]: Okay.
HANNAHB [to SELF]: Ugh, this is sucky.
HANNAHB: I just want to talk to Colton. But it's like, okay, another girl. Another girl. Another girl. Dang it, she just got there.
ERIN [to COLTON]: It's been a long night.
COLTON [to ERIN]: Yeah.
ERIN [to COLTON]: And I did not turn into a pumpkin.
COLTON [to ERIN]: Well, good.
HANNAHB: I'm starting to spiral. I want time with him. I am just ready, ready, ready.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: So, first, I need to tell youu I'm just so glad you are the bachelor. I would not be here if you weren't. There's a million things I want to ask you.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: Shoot. Go. Random question.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: What is the scariest thing you've ever done?
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: I would say open up about who I am in front of a lot of people. But also the most rewarding and best thing ever because I'm so comfortable in my skin.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: And that is probably one of the most attractive things about you.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: Thank you. What is your greatest fear?
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Not ‐‐ like, not being enough in everything I do. I put a lot of pressure on myself to excel and it's something I totally struggle with and I'm, like, working on it and trying to be open about it.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: I've been there, too. I have questioned myself at about that too
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Yeah, I have to do self checks.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: Yeah.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: So we are going to have an honest policy. We are going to do this and every time we talk, it's, like, super real talk.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Real talk.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: We'll both start with of these. You have to bite your thumb, though.
HANNAHB: I feel so much relief that I've made my presence known to him and I fully believe this is a connection made.
COLTON [to HANNAHB]: It was so good to talk with you.
HANNAHB [to COLTON]: Nice chatting with you.
HANNAHB: I'm hoping he wants to keep me around.
??? [to WOMEN]: I don't know who's going to get that.
DEMI [to WOMEN]: I would be really happy if did, but I think any of us can get it.
CAELYNN: I had a good time with Colton. I couldn't have asked for ###o be better. So I'd be very happy if I got that rose.
[laughs]
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Oh...
??? [to WOMEN]: Oh, it's going to somebody.
??? [to WOMEN]: There he goes.
JANE [to WOMEN]: If I was Colton, it would be, like, so hard for me to map my mind on who to give the rose to because there's so many of us.
WOMEN [to COLTON]: Oh, hi!
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Hi. Hannah, may I borrow you?
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Yes!
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Come down this way.
??? [to WOMEN]: Did he take someone?
??? [to WOMEN]: Who was it?
??? [to WOMEN]: The gold dress Hannah.
DEMI [to WOMEN]: Everyone's hearts are just crushing right now. We are all just sulking.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: So, from the beginning of the night, I put a lot of thought into the first impression. You reminded me a lot of ### when we sat and had our conversation. And while you were nervous I was, too.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Still am a little bit. You are doing good, you're doing good.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: And you are, too.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Okay, okay.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: And that's the best part. You sort of owned the nervousness, you owned your imperfections, and it was so nice and so refreshing to see and to hear. It's like, just so easy and so much fun and so enjoyable be around you. Your energy instantly lights me up. So, Hannah, will you acceps rose?
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Absolutely. This means seriously the world to me. This validates, like, everything.
COLTON: There is definitely chemistry and a nice spark with Hannah honestly, I didn't want top kissing her tonight.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Thank you. You look so handsome.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: You are so beautiful. Your eyes.
COLTON [to HANNAHG]: Thank you. I had the best first night. So, yeah.
HANNAHG [to COLTON]: Glad to hear it.
HANNAHG: I never, ever thought that I would be considered for this so the fact that he handed this to me, I was just like I haven't felt this quick any of these feelings ever. So the fact that my connection stood out to him, it is a dream come true. It really is.
[glass clinking]
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: Hey, hey.
[contestants exclaim]
WOMEN [to CHRIS]: What's up?
CHRIS [to ALL]: I would ask how your night's going, but I don't want to ask. The smile on the face is giving it away. Sorry to break up the party but it is that time, about time of our first rose ceremony.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: Well, I just want to say thank you to everybody. I know it was an extremely ###g night but you guys have exceeded all expectations and I really had my work cut out for me tonight. I have a tough decision and I will see you guys at the rose ceremony.
[contestants exclaim "bye!"]
ONYEKA: I feel a little sick, honestly.
NICOLE [to WOMEN]: Yeah, I guess I have worked all these weeks, I put everything on hold just to meet him. I just really hope he gives a second chance to prove him that we could have that connection, that spark.
ERIN [to WOMEN]: I don't feel like I really got the time that I needed. And, you know, if I don't a rose, I will be sad. And I will be upset.
CASSIE: Girls are really upset now because Catherine got to talk to Colton four times and some girls barely got to to him at all.
TAHZJUAN: If Catherine gets a rose tonight, it's going to drive everyone crazy. Everyone's going to lose their *bleep*.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: How are you doing, man?
COLTON [to CHRIS]: I'm good.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: Welcome to your first rose ceremony.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: Yeah.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: You had a good first night.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: Had a great first night.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: Did it go to expectations?
COLTON [to CHRIS]: This exceeded all my expectations. I was not expecting to develop feelings already, to have chemistry already. It's incredible.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: Night 1, the competition doesn't usually get heated. It already is.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: Yeah, yeah.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: We are all a little freaked out. A lot of us didn't get a ton of time with Colton tonight. Unfortunately, that's because Catherine stole him time and time and time again.
COLTON [to CHRIS]: I'm so nervous. I'm, like, feeling nauseous. I'm standing there shaking with my heart completely out of my chest. I would just be so upset if I went home tonight.
CHRIS [to COLTON]: You know what you are going to say, what you're going to do?

NICOLE: That's one more rose that he is giving away. I honestly feel like I could be going home tonight because Catherine talked to him four times and took time away from all of us. Like, who does that?

NICOLE [to COLTON]: Of course.
DEVIN: I am terrified that Catherine will get the final rose.
CHRIS [to ALL]: Ladies, Colton, this is the final rose tonight. When you are ready.
CHRIS [to CATHERINE]: Catherine. Catherine, will you accepts rose?
CATHERINE [to COLTON]: Yes.
CHRIS [to WOMEN]: Ladies, I am sorry. You did not receive a rose. Take a moment, say your goodbyes.
??? [to WOMEN]: Bye. Bye, boo. So nice meeting you. It was nice meeting you. Nice meeting you, too.
TAHZJUAN: Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Obviously with some of the girls tonight, I think he definitely made a mistake. I saw every single one of these people in my head earlier going home. So it doesn't make sense to me. I think I was taken out of this equation way too early.
??? [to WOMEN]: It was nice meeting you. It was very nice meeting you.
ERIN: I had my horse and carriage and I thought I was going to get my fairy tale ending. But that did not happen. So I am really upset because I really thought Colton was my prince charming.
DEVIN [to WOMEN]: Thank you for everything. It was so nice meeting you. Good luck. Have a great time.
COLTON [to DEVIN]: Thank you. You too.
DEVIN: It's hard when you know that you haven't made the impression you thought you did or wanted to. And you walk out of it not feeling your best. But on my end, I thought that he was some connection and there could have been potential there. But in the end, it wasn't enough.
COLTON [to WOMEN]: To all of you lovely ladies!
[contestants exclaim]
DEVIN: I don't know, I think it want to be okay. I want to be past it. And be okay with it. But it's hard, it's hard to get rejected.
WOMEN [in exclamation]: Guys, welcome home. Whoo! Yes! Yay! This is amazing.
