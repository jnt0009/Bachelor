<i>CHRIS HARRISON:</i><br/><i>Tonight on "The Bachelor"...</i>
<i>CAELYNN: Colton looks so hot.</i>
[women cheering]
‐ How are you guys doing?
<i>WOMAN:</i><br/><i>I just want to know him</i>
<i>and, like,</i><br/><i>the raw version of him.</i>
Why are you a virgin?
‐ Never even, like,<br/>a one‐night...
‐ No. I feel like those<br/>are awkward.
‐ No, they're fantastic.
<i>DEMI: When I want something,</i><br/><i>I'm going after it.</i>
<i>WOMAN: Girls are, like,</i><br/><i>really pulling out</i>
<i>all the stops</i><br/><i>to get his attention.</i>
‐ I actually have never kissed<br/>anyone before.
‐ Really?
<i>DEMI: Who knows</i><br/><i>what's gonna happen?</i>
‐ They're staying overnight?
<i>HANNAH B.: The other girls</i>
<i>are obviously super jealous</i><br/><i>and upset.</i>
‐ I wonder if someone is going<br/>to be sleeping with him.
If he's, like, vibing<br/>with somebody enough,
I think it could be<br/>a temptation.
‐ Can I interrupt?<br/>‐ You are kidding.
‐ Does she not have parents?
<i>DEMI:</i><br/><i>I think the other girls</i>
<i>are shaking in their boots.</i>
I want to show you<br/>my fantasy closet.
‐ Wait. What?<br/>‐ So ballsy.
‐ I don't know<br/>if it's appropriate.
<i>DEMI: Would you like</i><br/><i>to come home to this?</i>
<i>COLTON: [giggles] Dang!</i><br/><i>DEMI: Mmm.</i>
<i>CHRIS H.:</i><br/><i>It's all coming up tonight</i>
<i>on "The Bachelor."</i>
[water rushing,<br/>animals chattering]
‐ Oh, good morning.
Uh, it's the morning<br/>of the first group date
of this entire season,
and I'm super excited.
Today we're going to be going<br/>to a theater to...
tell stories of our firsts.
It's gonna be a lot of fun.
But I'm also really nervous.
This one's gonna set the tempo<br/>for the whole entire season.
And...
yeah.
Let it begin.
ALL: Colton!
‐ I woke up this morning<br/>with butterflies.
We're all, like, smitten.<br/>‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ And it's scary.<br/>[giggles]
Last night I may have<br/>kissed him.
I did.<br/>It was great.
‐ I'm excited.
‐ I know, are we all<br/>smitten by Colton?
‐ Everyone is.<br/>I'm not surprised we all are.
‐ I am beyond excited to
<i>hopefully start something</i><br/><i>really good with Colton.</i>
I'm stoked to be here.

<i>CHRIS H.: Hey, guys.</i><br/><i>Good morning.</i>
<i>ALL: Good morning!</i>

‐ Are you feeling good today?
‐ I feel great today.
Today is a damn good day<br/>to fall in love.
‐ Aw, yes.<br/>ALL: Yes!
‐ I see you all got settled in<br/>to your mansion.
ALL: Yes.
CHRIS H.: So what's it like,<br/>night one?
Was it what you expected?
‐ Um, it exceeded<br/>my expectations, for sure.
And, like, the moment that you<br/>get to sit down with Colton,
like, you immediately<br/>establish, like,
feelings for him.
And so, like,<br/>we just look forward
to getting to develop those<br/>more and more.
‐ Obviously, we're all dating<br/>the same guy.
Going forward, I'm definitely<br/>going to get
more competitive<br/>with you girls, so let's go.
[all laughing]
‐ Speaking of targets...
first impression rose? Hannah?
‐ Target? Ah, take it off!
‐ Look, if you learned<br/>anything on night one,
it's that time is everything.
And so, when you have time,<br/>when you can find it,
take advantage of it.
Are you guys ready to go?
ALL: Yes!<br/>‐ Let's do it!
‐ First date card right here.
I'll leave it.<br/>‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Who's gonna read it?<br/>‐ Oh, my God.
‐ So good luck to all of you.
Enjoy the dates.
Enjoy Colton, and, hopefully,
I'll see all of you soon.
ALL: Yes.
‐ Bye, ladies.<br/>ALL: Bye, Chris.
‐ All right, let's go, Katie!
‐ Oh, my God, I better be<br/>on that card.
<i>I feel like this is my chance</i><br/><i>to really meet Colton.</i>
<i>I want him to get to know</i><br/><i>my personality, like...</i>
I need to be on that card.

we hope that it's full<br/>of adventure

‐ Ooh.
MEGAN: My story is called,
"The First Time<br/>I [bleep] someone."
[all laughing]
The first time<br/>I [bleep] someone,
I was a little nervous.
I didn't feel confident.
I wasn't sure if I was there<br/>for the right reasons.
But I had a little talk<br/>with myself,
a little pep talk,
and it turns out
that I could do it,<br/>and I did do it,
and I went on to [bleep]<br/>a lot more people.
‐ Wow, okay.<br/>MEGAN: Thank you.
<i>ELYSE: So Nick and Megan</i><br/><i>kind of gave these stories</i>
with a lot of innuendos.<br/>[laughs]
‐ This is the story<br/>of the first time
that I plucked the blossom<br/>of a woman.
[laughter]
I was feeling insecure<br/>when I arrived
at her house, um...
<i>TRACY: Nick Offerman</i><br/><i>is telling a story</i>
about gardening,<br/>and it definitely had
a sexual undertone.
‐ She helped me part<br/>the [bleep], uh...
NICK: At which point, finally,
I did arrive at, uh...
the velvety petals<br/>of her blossom.
And I clipped it,<br/>and it was a beautiful rose.
‐ Oh.<br/>[giggling]
‐ It was very cryptic<br/>and unusual.
‐ In case you're wondering<br/>what's gonna happen today,
we're here to help you guys<br/>tell your own stories
about significant firsts<br/>in your lives.
You first kiss, your first pet,
the first time you went<br/>to jail,
anything that really stands out
as something that you would<br/>like to share with Colton‐‐

NICK: And then this evening
you're going to perform<br/>your stories
in front of an audience<br/>of 200 people.
‐ Whoa!<br/>‐ [laughing]
<i>TRACY: I think the goal</i><br/><i>of today</i>
is to just give Colton<br/>an idea of our personality
and give him a little bit<br/>of an insight
into who we are<br/>outside of the fancy gowns.
<i>I absolutely hope that</i><br/><i>at the end of this,</i>
Colton has a "first" story<br/>that includes me.

that everybody's<br/>in their underwear.
Or just pretend all<br/>those people aren't there
and it's just me sitting there.
‐ Or I could just<br/>tell everybody to leave.
‐ I don't know about that,<br/>but...

Talking in front of everybody<br/>is terrifying.

Hopefully if I see him<br/>in the audience or something,
it'll make me<br/>feel more calm.
‐ "So I was so nervous<br/>and excited

about people's first time<br/>doing different things.
‐ We are talking about<br/>our firsts.
And we're doing it<br/>in front of 200 people,

Colton, will you<br/>set us off, please?
[cheers and applause]
<i>HANNAH G.: I'm excited</i><br/><i>for Colton</i>
to get a glimpse of my past.
And I want to hear<br/>about his past too.
I want to hear Colton's story.
‐ So for most<br/>of my adult life,
I had a secret.
I was a virgin.
And as an athlete,
I thought I had to fit<br/>this mold.
I made up lies.
And I was uncomfortable
speaking my truth.
One day I get<br/>to the locker room,
and one of the veterans<br/>asks me;
he said, "How many girls<br/>have you slept with?"
So I sat there sweating.
"What's a good lie?<br/>Is it one?
Four? Ten? 100?"
[laughter]
"What am I gonna do?"
It finally came out<br/>of my mouth, and I said,
"Zero."
And I didn't know what<br/>the reaction was gonna be,
and I was expecting<br/>to get ridiculed.
And the first thing<br/>that I heard was,
"Wow, man, that's really cool."
For so many years,
I allowed this to be a burden<br/>on my life.
Uh, and it was unnecessary.
But for the first time,
I told the truth<br/>about my virginity.
Thank you.
[cheers and applause]
NICK: Thank you, Colton.
One day I hope<br/>to make love to Megan.
‐ Yeah. We‐‐<br/>[laughter]
We haven't gone<br/>all the way yet.
He's got a lot<br/>of illustrated manuals
that he still hasn't<br/>gotten through yet, and...
[laughter]
<i>ELYSE: I love that Colton is</i>
<i>very comfortable in his skin.</i>
<i>That speech,</i>
especially for a male<br/>to do that,
with all the stereotypes
that go into not only being<br/>an athlete,
<i>but just a male...</i>
it's pretty incredible.
I always dated men my age
or maybe just<br/>a little bit older.
You know, like, two, three,<br/>13 years older.
[laughter]
My 20s taught me a lot<br/>about life.
But now I find myself<br/>in my very, very early 30s as‐‐
for the first time,<br/>dating a younger man.
And, Colton...
[all ooh‐ing]
Now it's my turn to teach you<br/>a thing or two.
[cheers and applause]
<i>DEMI: Elyse,</i><br/><i>in her performance,</i>
she got up there, and she was<br/>willing to admit
that she was older<br/>in front of everybody.
<i>I thought she was so brave</i><br/><i>for doing that.</i>
It was so bold of her.
<i>I mean, there's no advantage</i><br/><i>to being an older woman here.</i>
NICOLE: Living in Miami,
every single guy<br/>I've ever dated
has either been Cuban,<br/>Colombian,
or, like, a mix of the two.
But everything was about<br/>to change
because I was about to get<br/>the taste
of the whitest bread<br/>I've ever tasted.
[laughter]
<i>I could just feel, like,</i><br/><i>Colton looking at me.</i>
He sees, like,<br/>that goofy side of me,
<i>and then he was cracking up</i><br/><i>the whole time.</i>
<i>The fact that I made him laugh</i>
was, like, such<br/>a good, like, feeling.
‐ School dance after<br/>school dance went by dateless.
Most of the time<br/>I felt invisible.
Fast forward<br/>to the other night.
That feeling struck back again.
And then you, Colton, handed me
one of the most meaningful<br/>roses I've ever received.
[cheers and applause]
NICK: I was touched by that.
But it sort of took away
from the rose that you gave me<br/>earlier today.
[laughter]
‐ Some of the stories<br/>were super sincere.
‐ This story is about<br/>the first time
I felt comfortable<br/>in my own skin.
‐ Some of them<br/>were a little more aggressive.
‐ I grab my whistle<br/>and my lifeguard gear,
and I saved him from drowning<br/>in some bitches.
[laughing]<br/>[cheers and applause]
Let me just add, there are<br/>some thirsty girls here,
so I had to do it.
[laughing]
‐ But I can be aggressive too.
Someone came up to me<br/>and blew a whistle,
actually, and said Colton<br/>was drowning in bitches.
[laughter]
I'm a good swimmer.
I'm Mike Phelps, [bleep].
[cheers and applause]
‐ So my story is
the first time I tried<br/>to date a virgin.
It's sophomore year of college.
There is this gorgeous<br/>fraternity president.
And come to find out<br/>he's a virgin.
This other girl<br/>in my sorority and I
decided that we both<br/>really liked him
and we were going<br/>to compete for him.
<i>NICOLE: Tracy kind of tells,</i>
like, the most dramatic story<br/>I've ever heard.
‐ And as I start to wake up,<br/>she punches me in the face.
<i>NICOLE: She's caused someone</i><br/><i>to punch her in the face.</i>
So can you imagine what she is<br/>capable of here?
‐ When I got a hold of him,<br/>he was not a virgin anymore.
But it was the best sex<br/>he ever had.
[cheers and applause]
<i>NICOLE: It was not</i><br/><i>a romantic story whatsoever.</i>
<i>If I were Colton, I'd be like,</i>
"Please get this girl<br/>away from me."
‐ What morals do we take<br/>from that story?
‐ Well, I think that<br/>it is a cautionary tale
for the other ladies<br/>in the house.
[laughter]
And so we've come<br/>to our final storyteller‐‐
Demi.
[cheers and applause]
‐ I'm gonna tell a story
that is going to blow<br/>the crowd's mind.
<i>And I just can't wait</i><br/><i>to make that crowd</i>
fall in love with me.
So I met this guy at this<br/>really crazy party.
And I really wanted<br/>to kiss him,
but I was just way too scared.
Usually when I see<br/>something I want,
I am bold enough to go after it<br/>immediately.
And so I had to tell myself,
"I'm not waiting any longer.
When I want something,<br/>I'm going after it."
[all screaming]
‐ Oh.
[all ooh‐ing]
<i>TRACY: Demi is so immature.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna lie,</i><br/><i>my stomach was</i>
starting to get<br/>a little tied in knots
<i>'cause, like, I didn't</i><br/><i>want to sit there</i>
<i>and see her kiss him.</i>
‐ And that is the story
of how I got the first<br/>group date rose.
[all cheering]
<i>TRACY: Like, trust me,</i>
I want to kiss him just as much<br/>as the next girl does,
but I also want to establish
<i>some type of connection</i><br/><i>with him</i>
so that I'm not just<br/>forcing it on him.
<i>Demi is such a child.</i>
‐ Ladies and gentlemen,<br/>let's hear it one more time
for Colton and the ladies.
[cheers and applause]
<i>DEMI: This date was</i><br/><i>the craziest thing of my life.</i>
I think that tonight
I'm gonna have<br/>to definitely, like,
show Colton some depth in me
and give him a little more<br/>serious side of me.
<i>I just can't wait to, like,</i>
<i>grab him</i><br/><i>and talk to him again.</i>
<i>Then, of course,</i><br/><i>get the group date rose.</i>
[cheers and applause]<br/>‐ Bye!
<i>Bye!</i>
<i>CHRIS H.: Coming up...</i>
<i>DEMI: He needs a girl</i><br/><i>in his life</i>
to take a bit more<br/>of a dominant role.
<i>WOMAN: Someone is going to be</i><br/><i>sleeping with him.</i>
‐ It's very intimate.<br/>‐ Very intimate.
‐ I definitely think<br/>I can learn a thing or two.
<i>ELYSE:</i><br/><i>This virgin moves fast.</i>
‐ I actually have never kissed<br/>anyone before.
‐ Really?<br/>‐ Yeah.
‐ I don't know<br/>if I'm mentally prepared.
<i>Who knows what's gonna happen.</i>
<i>CHRIS H.: And then...</i>
‐ I want to show you<br/>my fantasy closet.

‐ I personally wouldn't go<br/>right up to him

ALL: Cheers!
‐ I am going into the<br/>cocktail party really nervous,
<i>'cause yesterday</i><br/><i>my team lost the competition.</i>
And, you know, I didn't get<br/>that one‐on‐one time this week
that I really<br/>was looking forward to.
‐ Hi, how are you?
‐ Good, how are you?<br/>‐ Good.
<i>COURTNEY: So I need to</i><br/><i>show him who Courtney is,</i>
because I think we really<br/>could hit it off,
<i>if given the chance.</i>
Well, I just really wanted
to thank you for having me<br/>on the date yesterday.
‐ I noticed that you were,<br/>like, leading the yellow team.
‐ Oh, I was the team leader,<br/>for sure.
‐ Yeah. Which is cool.<br/>‐ That I'm like a dork and‐‐
‐ You're a little more fierce
and a little more feisty<br/>than what I thought.
‐ Definitely.<br/>‐ I like it.
‐ I'm the oldest of five.<br/>‐ Yeah.
‐ And I guess that's where my<br/>leadership qualities come from.
‐ Yeah.
‐ Because my youngest<br/>sibling's two years old.
And that's matured me a lot.
I'm 23 years old,<br/>but I can truly say
that I'm ready for a family.
I'm ready to just<br/>fall deeply in love.
And part of that is just<br/>growing up early
and being very mature
and having to be<br/>kind of responsible
for four other people.<br/>‐ Yeah.
‐ Like, my typical Saturday<br/>is, like,
going to soccer practice...<br/>‐ Yeah. Yeah.
‐ And, like,<br/>bringing the snacks
and just hanging out<br/>with all the other moms.
I'm not a mom, but...<br/>‐ [laughs]
‐ Like, I'll go‐‐<br/>[laughs] I feel like
I have a very, like, mom life<br/>without any children.
And from what I saw, like,<br/>I thought we would
really connect<br/>if you got a chance to...
‐ Yeah.<br/>‐ Get to know more about me
‐ Well, I thought the same.<br/>I was like, "Oh, man."
I really felt like you embodied<br/>what yesterday was all about.
‐ It's just awesome‐‐<br/>it feels really good.
Like, I had a good one‐on‐one<br/>conversation with him.
<i>If I get a rose, that would</i><br/><i>make me feel really good.</i>
I'm happy.<br/>[chuckles]
I'm really happy.<br/>I'm sorry.
KIRPA: He has to send a lot<br/>of us home tonight probably.
SYDNEY: Yeah.<br/>‐ So it's like which one‐‐
like, 'cause he didn't<br/>really get to talk to us.
‐ Not that much.<br/>‐ So he doesn't want regrets.
<i>SYDNEY: I'm nervous.</i>
I know I have the potential<br/>of going home.
I'm one of, I think,<br/>the eight girls
that hasn't really sat down<br/>and talked to him.
‐ You know<br/>a little bit about me.
‐ Yeah. Yeah.<br/>‐ So I, like‐‐
What are you looking for?<br/>‐ Just a best friend.
Like, somebody<br/>I can have fun with.
<i>SYDNEY:</i><br/><i>For me, that's frustrating</i>
because I feel<br/>like I'm something
I just don't think<br/>he's opened his eyes to it yet.
‐ I definitely<br/>saw your personality.
‐ Okay.
‐ And that's why I was like,<br/>"I want her to stick around."
‐ Based on what<br/>I think he's seen of me so far,
I think he sees that<br/>I'm fun, that I'm easygoing.
<i>But as of right now,</i><br/><i>what he hasn't seen is,</i>
<i>like, my deeper side</i><br/><i>and the reasons</i>
<i>why I'm truly here.</i>
Hi, friend.<br/>‐ Hello.
‐ Can I interrupt?<br/>KIRPA: Yes.
<i>SYDNEY: If I go home tonight,</i>
I don't think<br/>it'll be worth it,
the sacrifice I made.
Yesterday was fun.<br/>‐ I'm glad you guys had fun.
‐ I mean, fun<br/>for the most part, yeah.
‐ Until the very end?<br/>‐ Until I lost.
‐ Yeah.<br/>‐ Yeah.
how hard I was, like,<br/>trying to win.
I don't know<br/>if you, like, noticed.
‐ Yes.<br/>‐ But I think it was worth it.
And I might have<br/>cheated a little bit.
But no one saw. It's fine.<br/>‐ [laughs]
How did you cheat?
‐ Okay, so I learned<br/>that if you stick your oar
in the other boat, you can<br/>pull the boat backwards.
‐ No, you didn't.
‐ So then did you see<br/>that moment
where we, like,<br/>charged forward?
‐ You sling‐shotted your team<br/>in the wrong direction?
‐ I did.<br/>I was holding on to the boat.
But I was, like,<br/>I was doing my best.
‐ Hey, you know what they say.
If you ain't cheating,<br/>you ain't trying.
‐ Exactly.
It does feel good
because I wasn't feeling<br/>this way
when I started this<br/>evening, so...
<i>I'm excited to, like,</i><br/><i>finally get to talk to him</i>
<i>and progress our relationship.</i>

‐ Hello, hello!<br/>‐ How are you?
‐ I'm really sorry.<br/>‐ Whoo.
‐ As you know, I like to make<br/>an entrance.
‐ And I'm honestly feeling<br/>just a little bit horny.
[both laugh]
‐ That's what you're doing.
‐ And so I just had to<br/>take some time to let it out.
‐ Yeah.
‐ But I'm really<br/>excited to see you.
‐ What was with the horn?<br/>SYDNEY: She has an air horn.
<i>Normally I would have</i><br/><i>let that just go</i>
<i>and, like, kind of</i><br/><i>retreated backwards,</i>
but I wasn't finished talking.
And I felt like<br/>we were in a good place,
and then<br/>we got interrupted, so...
<i>I'm willing to do whatever</i><br/><i>it takes to get my time back.</i>
I found more noisemakers.<br/>[pan clanging]
‐ You can come back<br/>in five minutes.
I'm not leaving.<br/>‐ You're not?
‐ No.<br/>[pan clanging]
‐ Wait, I'm so confused.<br/>What's happening?
‐ I don't know.
Is this to give us anxiety?<br/>'Cause we already have it.
[pot clanging]<br/>SYDNEY: Let's make more noise.
Okay, time's up.
[distant pot clanging]<br/>‐ What is going on?
<i>COURTNEY: It's way too early</i><br/><i>for it to be this crazy.</i>
This cocktail party<br/>just started.
Like, I literally just<br/>put on my heels an hour ago.
[pot clanging]
[air horn blaring]
DEMI: That is so funny!<br/>[laughter]
‐ I don't think<br/>Sydney thought it was funny,

<i>TRACY: I'm the oldest person</i><br/><i>in this house.</i>
<i>I'm not a child.</i>

‐ How about kids?
‐ Um...I'm gonna be<br/>so honest with you.
‐ Yeah.<br/>‐ As of right now,
I just miss having‐‐<br/>having a bunch of dogs.

‐ I've been open
to meeting that man that<br/>I want to marry for a while
<i>and have it progress</i><br/><i>to the next level.</i>
‐ You have an eyelash,<br/>like, right there.
‐ Get it, get it.<br/>‐ I don't think it's yours.
[both laugh]
‐ [snorts]
‐ I didn't come here<br/>just to have fun.
Hi.<br/>‐ Hello.
‐ Can I steal you away?<br/>‐ Yeah.
‐ Of course, it was good<br/>to see you.
‐ I appreciate it, yes.
<i>TRACY: I would like</i><br/><i>to have someone</i>
that I can just be<br/>comfortable with
and be in love with.

‐ "I'm looking for life's<br/>greatest treasure.
Colton."
‐ Oh, God, I'm so glad<br/>I have you.
<i>‐ Hannah and Caelynn</i><br/><i>know each other from pageants,</i>
<i>but they had a falling‐out</i>
<i>and they are</i><br/><i>no longer friends.</i>
And now they're on<br/>a group date, so...
<i>it's gonna be interesting</i><br/><i>to see how they handle it.</i>
‐ Let's go.<br/>‐ Bye, y'all.
<i>‐ I think today</i><br/><i>will be interesting,</i>
because Hannah B. and I<br/>have had our differences
in the past...
[all cheering]
But I don't want our past<br/>to come in between
more important things,<br/>like Colton.
<i>So I just want to have fun</i><br/><i>on the date today</i>
and just be with Colton.
<i>[rousing music]</i>
<i>‐ Guys, I am so excited.</i>
<i>‐ Let's go, ladies!</i>
[all cheering, laughing]
<i>‐ Let's do it!</i>
[thunder crashing]
‐ Oh, my gosh.
<i>‐ This is a story</i>
<i>of love and heartbreak.</i>
[all cheering]
<i>But also a pirate story.</i>
<i>This is the story</i><br/><i>of Captain Colton.</i>
[all cheering]
<i>In search</i><br/><i>of the greatest treasure</i>
<i>the world has ever seen:</i>
<i>love.</i>
[all cheering]
<i>‐ Colton's standing</i><br/><i>on this pirate boat,</i>
<i>and he's looking</i><br/><i>sexy as hell.</i>
And I'm like, "Hello, Colton.
"Life's greatest treasure<br/>is standing
right in front of you."
[blows landing]
‐ Hey, you knuckleheads!<br/>Knock it off!
[all laughing]
all: Oh!
<i>[swarthy music]</i>
<i>♪ ♪</i>
‐ Yeah!
<i>‐ Oh, my God,</i><br/><i>Colton's so sexy.</i>
‐ Come on down.<br/><i>‐ I'm like, "Wow."</i>
I think today is gonna be fun.
‐ Well, first off,<br/>welcome to my pirate ship.
Today I would like<br/>to introduce you
to two of my friends:
pirates Chris and Cindy.
‐ Ahoy, ladies.<br/>all: Ahoy!
‐ I hear you be searching<br/>for love, aye?
all: Aye!<br/>Arr!
‐ Now, ladies, you're gonna<br/>learn how to be pirates.
At the end of that training,<br/>two of you will be chosen
to compete<br/>for Captain Colton's heart.
all: Yes!
‐ What I want you to do<br/>is go get changed
and meet me back here<br/>on the ship.
Aye?<br/>all: Aye!
Aye, aye!
‐ Good.
[indistinct chatter]
<i>‐ The two best pirates</i><br/><i>are going to compete</i>
<i>for Colton's heart,</i><br/><i>and it's perfect for me</i>
because I'm a cutthroat<br/>kind of chick.
I feel like Shakira, Shakira.
<i>The job of a pirate</i><br/><i>is to steal,</i>
<i>and I'm here to steal</i><br/><i>Colton's heart.</i>
I don't want to be another one<br/>of those yo‐ho‐hos.
‐ On to the pirate training!<br/>all: Aye!
‐ You are going to be<br/>taking these
and trying to knock<br/>each other off.
‐ Here we go.
<i>‐ I am so excited</i><br/><i>to get in there</i>
and show what I can do.
‐ Begin!
<i>[upbeat rock music]</i>
all: Oh!
‐ I'm the winner.<br/>‐ You win.
‐ Your weapon.
‐ I am super competitive.
Arr!<br/>‐ There we go.
‐ So I'm going to step up<br/>to the plate,
and the Hannah monster<br/>is gonna come out.
‐ Begin.
‐ [squeaking]
[hollers]
[laughter]
‐ Oh, [bleep].
‐ Begin!
‐ [gasps]
[all chattering]
‐ Hannah gets so intense<br/>in competition...
‐ Begin!<br/>‐ Hannah, you're strong.
I know you're strong,<br/>so, like, be‐‐be gentle.
So I'm nervous,<br/>because there is just, like,
a weird tension thing<br/>between us.
[squeals]<br/>I don't like this.
[laughter]
‐ Okay, Hannah!
‐ I know how strong she is.<br/>That's not fair.
<i>‐ I'm killing this right now,</i>
and I definitely think<br/>he noticed me.
‐ You did a good job.<br/>‐ Feel pretty good.
So I'm feeling good.
‐ Yeah.
Oh, there's something<br/>going on over there.
‐ [laughs]<br/>Ouch, I lost an eye.
[laughs]
<i>‐ It's a little frustrating</i><br/><i>to watch Caelynn</i>
engage with Colton<br/>right in front of me.
‐ Nailed it.<br/>‐ [laughs]
‐ I'm trying my hardest<br/>to not get upset.
‐ Come down to the captain.
<i>‐ But then Caelynn's</i><br/><i>just everywhere.</i>
‐ [laughs]
‐ Oh, my gosh.
It's like, ugh.
<i>I didn't come here to compete</i><br/><i>in another pageant.</i>
‐ So we have made<br/>a decision.
There are gonna be two of you
competing for<br/>Captain Colton's heart.
‐ Tracy.
[applause]
‐ And the other woman<br/>we chose:
Caelynn.<br/>‐ Great job.
‐ Honestly, um...
<i>this sucks.</i>
‐ I'm excited.<br/>‐ I'm so excited.
‐ And the rest of you<br/>get to watch
from the poop deck<br/>right over there.
[laughter]
‐ I'm gonna slide on<br/>the eye patch
and pretend like<br/>I can't see it.

[cheers and applause]
<i>‐ Is there anyone who thinks</i>
<i>that they have the strength</i><br/><i>or the courage</i>
<i>to save Captain Colton?</i>
‐ I will save you,<br/>my captain!
‐ [blows raspberry]
‐ Not if I get to you first!
‐ Boo!
<i>‐ I am so excited</i><br/><i>to save Captain Colton.</i>
I think I'm gonna win.
That's what I'm here for.
‐ Go!
<i>‐ I don't think it's possible</i><br/><i>for Tracy to win.</i>
She is the worst pirate<br/>I've ever seen.
<i>‐ Here comes Tracy</i><br/><i>down the rope.</i>
