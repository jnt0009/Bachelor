1,testimony,laughs,cassie,aside,"Hi, I'm Cassie, and welcome to Huntington Beach, California. I love the beach. I just like being out on the water. But I also enjoy working with people as well. I am a speech pathologist and a grad student. When I am working with a child and I see that I have helped them to communicate, it is probably one of the best feelings in the world. As a speech pathologist I'm supposed to be a good communicator and I really hope that that translates to when I go to meet Colton. I am so excited that Colton is the bachelor. Oh, my gosh. I am so nervous to meet him actually. My greatest hope is that when I meet Colton, we really click, and hit it off, and I leave with him.",1
2,testimony,,hannahb,aside,"Hi, I'm Hannah. Welcome to Alabama! I grew up in Titletown, home of the champions. I love Tuscaloosa, proud to be an Alabama fan. Roll tide! I'm miss Alabama, which makes me a queen here. Getting to serve my great state, that was truly a dream come true. It's fun. I have my own autograph pads. I always like to leave an encouraging message. Yeah, but I'm a total train wreck. I just am hoping that Colton will like the good, bad, and hot mess. The hot mess express and I'm the conductor.",1
3,exclamation,,hannahb,self,"C‐o‐l‐t‐o‐n, Colton, Colton, you're a ten!",1
4,testimony,,hannahb,aside,"So I've only kissed four guys that were my boyfriends. I am not a virgin, but sex a big deal so Colton is the bachelor and that he is a virgin is super appealing to me. I honestly couldn't believe people were like, ""what?"" I was like, oh, my God, it's so awesome. Like, it is so amazing. But then I am like, ""how?"". Colton, I hope you are ready for Alabama Hannah because Alabama Hannah is ready for you.",1

6,testimony,,katie,aside,"Hi, my name is katie, 26 years old and I am from the east coast. I came to L.A. because I wanted to dance. I love dancing. And as much as I love creative freedom and the arts, I'm a person who wants stability and security. The kind of love I hope to have one day is like my parents. They have been married for 30 years. They are inseparable. I love that. I want that. I am really excited to meet Colton because he has blonde hair, green eyes, athletic, super kind, kind of weird. I seem to have a very specific type. If he ends up liking the person I am and I end up loving the person he is, then 100%, I could be engaged at the end of this.",1
7,testimony,laughs,heather,aside,"Hi I'm Heather, I'm 22, and I was born and raised in California. If I'm not working, I am at the beach. I'm a beach girl through and through. I paddleboard, I am always in the water, always at the beach. But here's the thing, I hae never had sex before and I've never kissed anyone. ""Hey, I'm heather, I've never kissed anyone,"" that is really not my opening typically. I met Colton at his charity event in San Diego for 15 seconds. Took quick pictures, and is like, okay, I like that guy. Colton seems to have all the qualities that I'm looking for in a future husband. I could definitely see myself having my first kiss with Colton.",1
8,testimony,"laughs, laughs",onyeka,aside,"Hi, my name is Onyeka E. I am 24 years old and I live in Dallas, Texas. I grew up in a strong, traditional Nigerian family. My full name could not fit in the thing that they put down here. I am not afraid to embarras myself. Anyone who knows me knows I will do the weirdest thingn public. I'm loud and obnoxious at times. I do not care what people think about me. I think I'm a lot to handle. but I also have a really bg heart that comes with that. My parents are from Nigeria. They dated for two weeks and then they were engaged. I'm a firm believer in when you know, you know. Colton, he has all the morals, and all the characters I look for in a guy. And he's hot. If I was the person that Colton can gave his virginity to, I would definitely bring out all the tricks.",1
9,testimony,,nicole,aside,"Hola, me llamo Nicole y bienvenido a Miami. Being single when you are relatively attractive, it's hard because there are so many singles in Miami. So when I go out, you're not going to meet eligible bachelors. They're part of that hookup culture. I'm not about that. I'm looking for the real deal. My life in Miami is totally focused and centered on my family. My brother, A. J., suffers from autism. He is part of the package deal. He is going to be with me always. My mom and my grandma, my brother, are, like, my world. I'm so excited to meet Colton. I could just tell he would be so welcoming to, like, to my family and to my life.",1
10,testimony,"laughs, laughs",kirpa,aside,"Hi, my name is Kirpa. I'm a dental hygienist from Whittier, California. I really hope that Colton flosses, because being a dental hygienist, that is one of the first things I tend to gravitate to. It would be a good experienve to clean Colton's teeth. With Colton, that's as close as you can get right now, so I'll take it. I am blessed to have a fantastic family, a loving family from different backgrounds that loves each other. And puts up with one another. The only thing that has been missing is someone to share that with. The end of this, if it coud lead to an engagement, that would be amazing. Fingers crossed.",1
11,testimony,"laughs, laughs",demi,aside,"Hi, I'm Demi Burnett, 23 years old, and I'm hot doggin' for Colton. Vroom vroom! My friends and family would describe me as super bubbly and outgoing, a little sassy, country girl. I don't mind getting my has dirty and having fun. I've never had a serious relationship. I live with my dad and my stepmom. My dad always had the proper environment for us and so we've always been with him. My mom, she had to go to federal prison. She's there because of embezzlement. My mom is actually gonna get out very soon and the next time that I would potentiay see her would be with Colton. I'm really excited for Colton. I know that he's a virgin, it is kind of concerning. If you only ever have a vanilla cupcake, well, how do you know you don't like chocolate? How do you know you don't like strawberry? I feel like you got to try all the cupcakes first to know what you want. I am the damn confetti cake.",1
12,testimony,,colton,aside,"I'm Colton Underwood. I'm 26 and I never expected to be the next bachelor. I know not everybody's going to like me. I know I have a lot of room grow, but I also have an idea of what I want now. And that is what is so exciting about all this. I am the first virgin bachelor and it's crazy to even think about that. This is an opportunity of a lifetime, and I couldn't be more hopeful and excited. But then I also feel real nervous. Grade school Colton probaby would be really shy and timid, the fact that he was just named the bachelor. I grew up in a pretty conservative environment. I was at a Christian school I was always, like, the fat, chunky, awkward, weird kid. I didn't have girlfriends. I wanted to fit in so bad, but I felt very alone. A lot of days, I didn't want to go to school. My confidence in myself didn't come until my later years in high school. The one thing I knew how to do really well was football. When things were good, it was because of football. And that is why I got lost in it. I made it to the NFL. And for me, it was so special. I've had such a great life. I've had so many cool opportunities but the one thing I've been missing is somebody to share those with. I do know what love is. I mean, I've been in love before. And I remember how good I felt in those relationships. Falling in love with Becca was very eye‐opening. The comfort level was there chemistry was there. I was so open, I was so vulnerable. I was ready to really the next step. I was ready to lose my virginity to Becca. I was devastated when that relationship ended. And as tough and as challenging as that was, everything that has happened over the last year has been so transformative and so good for me. It's just the perfect time for me to focus on finding the person who I'm going to be spending the rest of my life with. I'm here to fall in love, and I'm here because I know how real it was when I was on the other side.",1
13,dialogue,,chris,colton,What's it like being announced the bachelor?,1
14,dialogue,,colton,chris,"For me, it was a little bit unexpected but it was something I was so grateful for, just the opportunity that I now knom going to have in front of me.",1

17,dialogue,,chris,colton,Of course.,1
18,dialogue,,colton,chris,"Some of the comments, I could see where they come I get it. They think I'm not ready. And it's a fine balance because I'm not here to do it for the fans or do it to win people over. I'm doing this for me.",1
19,dialogue,,chris,colton,"How much of the negativity and ""he's not ready"" do you think has to do with your virginity?",1
20,dialogue,,colton,chris,"That ‐‐ that's sort of thee stigma around being a virgin. Oh, he's not romantic, oh, he's not going to be a good bachelor.",1
21,dialogue,,chris,colton,That he's not a man.,1
22,dialogue,,colton,chris,"Yeah. And that got thrown at me this year. That was the thing, for the first time in my life, what I feared people might say to me actually got said to me. I mean, it is one of those things, I'm not waiting for a ring. I'm not waiting for marriage. I'm waiting to be in love. I'm waiting for it to feel right, to take our relationship to the next step.",1
23,dialogue,,chris,colton,"You are about to have women from all over the country coming here just to meet you. Do you believe in love at first sight? Do you think you will see a girl tonight and go, ""that's the one?""",1
24,dialogue,,colton,chris,I thought about that.,1
25,dialogue,,chris,colton,It's cool to think about.,1
26,dialogue,,colton,chris,"It is very cool to think about. But then, part of me, I don't want that because I just want to treat every relationship differently.",1
27,testimony,,colton,aside,"Being back here at the mansion reminds me that this works. This is real. And I am so humble and I ao grateful for this opportunity, but I am also so hopeful. This is my time. I am diving headfirst, and I'm going. And I can't wait to get started.",1

141,dialogue,laughter,colton,crowd,"So for most of my adult life, I had a secret. I was a virgin. And as an athlete, I thought I had to fit this mold. I made up lies. And I was uncomfortable speaking my truth. One day I get to the locker room, and one of the veterans asks me; he said, ""How many girls have you slept with?"" So I sat there sweating. ""What's a good lie? Is it one? Four? Ten? 100?"" ""What am I gonna do?"" It finally came out of my mouth, and I said, ""Zero."" And I didn't know what the reaction was gonna be, and I was expecting to get ridiculed. And the first thing that I heard was, ""Wow, man, that's really cool."" For so many years, I allowed this to be a burden on my life. Uh, and it was unnecessary. But for the first time, I told the truth about my virginity. Thank you.",2

147,sound,cheers and applause,,,,2
148,testimony,,demi,aside,"Elyse, in her performance, she got up there, and she was willing to admit that she was older in front of everybody. I thought she was so brave for doing that. It was so bold of her. I mean, there's no advantage to being an older woman here.",2
149,dialogue,laughter,nicole,crowd,"Living in Miami, every single guy I've ever dated has either been Cuban, Colombian, or, like, a mix of the two. But everything was about to change because I was about to get the taste of the whitest bread I've ever tasted.",2
150,testimony,,nicole,aside,"I could just feel, like, Colton looking at me. He sees, like, that goofy side of me, and then he was cracking up the whole time. The fact that I made him laugh was, like, such a good, like, feeling.",2
151,dialogue,,hannahb,crowd,"School dance after school dance went by dateless. Most of the time I felt invisible. Fast forward to the other night. That feeling struck back again. And then you, Colton, handed me one of the most meaningful roses I've ever received.",2

153,dialogue,,nick,crowd,I was touched by that. But it sort of took away from the rose that you gave me earlier today.,2

169,testimony,,demi,aside,I'm gonna tell a story that is going to blow the crowd's mind. And I just can't wait to make that crowd fall in love with me.,2
170,dialogue,all screaming,demi,crowd,"So I met this guy at this really crazy party. And I really wanted to kiss him, but I was just way too scared. Usually when I see something I want, I am bold enough to go after it immediately. And so I had to tell myself, ""I'm not waiting any longer. When I want something, I'm going after it.""",2
171,sound,all ooh‐ing,,,,2

284,dialogue,,tracy,onyeka,"Okay, but, I mean, he's not gonna not say that, knowing that she's a very forward person. She was probably like, ""Did you like how I kissed you?"" or whatever. I just think it's an immaturity level, honestly.",2
285,dialogue,,onyeka,tracy,Yeah.,2

327,dialogue,,hannahg,colton,So... I'm very excited.,2
328,testimony,,demi,aside,"I'm not worried about the other girls. I think that Colton will realize that he needs a girl in his life who is more, you know, bold and confident and to take a bit more of a dominant role.",2
329,dialogue,,colton,catherine,You threw that microphone down.,2
330,dialogue,,catherine,colton,How funny was that?,2
331,dialogue,,colton,catherine,Yeah.,2
332,testimony,,demi,aside,"I think that Colton is looking for a girl who can take charge and take control of him. Even if he, like, doesn't know that he's looking for that, I think that that's what he needs.",2

But it's something that's really important, especially in relationships, because it's something that, um... has come in between, like, intimacy and just a lot of different things in my life. Um...so four years ago, I was a sophomore in college. It was actually four years ago in October, so... 2014 of October. And, um, me and three of my girlfriends went to one of my friends' houses, and they‐‐they drugged our wine.

And I was like‐‐I just had this pit in my stomach, like, something really bad happened last night. And my girlfriend called me and said the three of us were all sexually assaulted. Um, her and my other girlfriend passed out in a bed at the party, and two men came in and had sex with them in the same bed at the same time while they were incapacitated. And... then the girlfriend who didn't drink the wine called me and told me not only did a guy come home and have sex with me, um, another guy... I was passed out on a couch from the drugs, and he was like, ""Watch what I'm about to do,"" with all his fraternity brothers around me. And lifted up my dress, while they watched and laughed and took photos and Snapchats and... Um, it was horrible. It was absolutely horrible. And I did everything that I was supposed to do. I went to the police the next day. I tried to get a rape kit done. I was turned away by a hospital, which is illegal. And I went to another hospital. They did a rape kit. Um, the results were inconclusive, because so much time had passed because the first hospital turned me away. And the men got away with it, except for one. One of them did get expelled. The rest of them got away with it.",4

843,dialogue,,courtney,demi,"I think every single person in the house, especially myself, can agree that if anyone isn't here for the right reasons, it is Demi.",4
844,dialogue,,demi,women,"And as I was walking out she said, ""Well, I wish I could say I was doing good, but..."" So I know she's just in there bashing me.",4
845,dialogue,,courtney,colton,"You only see this much of Demi. I see this much of Demi, and I see how she acts, and what she says and what she does.",4
846,dialogue,,demi,women,"Nobody wants to be around her most of the time, because she is so negative. She complains all the time, and she makes everybody feel like crap.",4
847,dialogue,,colton,courtney,"I mean, so, you just told me the whole house thinks she's the cancer. She just told me the whole house thinks you're the cancer. I'm trying‐‐I'm...",4
848,dialogue,,courtney,colton,"I think what she said is the furthest thing from the truth. She isn't here for you. You could be anybody. The fact that you're the bachelor, and the fact that this is a TV show is the reason why she's here.",4
849,dialogue,,colton,courtney,"I mean, that's‐‐ for me, that's like, the worse thing to hear. Because like, that‐‐ coming into this, like, my greatest fear is someone that's here to win.",4
850,dialogue,,courtney,colton,"That's all she's ever said is that, ""This is a game. I'm gonna play the game the right way.""",4
851,dialogue,,colton,courtney,She said that?,4
852,dialogue,,courtney,colton,"Yes, 100%.",4
853,testimony,,colton,aside,Hearing that is making me sort of question now my relationship with Demi. This is my worst nightmare and my greatest fear coming alive right now. Is the Demi that I see the real Demi or is she somebody else?,4
854,dialogue,,colton,courtney,"All right, well, I appreciate everything that you just told me. I really do.",4
855,testimony,,courtney,aside,"I'm a very kind, patient, loving, caring person until you press the wrong button, and that's not a button you wanna press. I'm not gonna let anyone step on me. I will be patient with you, but the moment that you try my character, I'm done with you. All bets are off at this point.",4
856,dialogue,,???,courtney,"Hey, Court.",4
857,dialogue,,courtney,women,I would like to take a poll. Raise your hand if you think I'm the cancer of the house.,4

861,dialogue,,demi,women,Yeah.,4
862,dialogue,,women,demi,Why? Why?,4
863,dialogue,,demi,women,Because I do feel that way. I feel like you are.,4

865,dialogue,,courtney,demi,In what ways?,4
866,dialogue,,demi,courtney,I just‐‐that's how I feel. I feel like you are the cancer of the house.,4
867,dialogue,,courtney,demi,Because I had a calm and concise conversation?,4
868,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"You did not have a calm and concise conversation with me, dude. You were mean to me.",4
869,dialogue,,courtney,demi,"And that is how you reacted to me. And I said, ""Let's bring it down. Let's have a conversation.""",4
870,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"No, that's not how you were at all. You were mean, you attacked me, you said crazy things about my character.",4
871,dialogue,,courtney,demi,I didn't attack you.,4
872,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"Yes, you did.",4
873,dialogue,,courtney,demi,But I think I should have.,4
874,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"You already did, Courtney.",4
875,dialogue,,courtney,demi,I was very calm. I was very concise.,4
876,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"No, you attacked me. You said the meanest things people have ever said to me in my life that night. You said I was playing God. You said that I‐‐you insinuated that I had no class. You questioned how old I was when we're the same *bleep* age.",4
877,dialogue,,courtney,demi,"Because your maturity sometimes is very telling. That doesn't mean I'm being mean, but sometimes you act very immature.",4
878,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"No, you were very mean.",4
879,dialogue,,courtney,demi,"Like, I think you should probably take a time‐out.",4
880,testimony,,demi,aside,I am so not in the wrong in this situation. She is only attacking me because of her own insecurities.,4
881,dialogue,,courtney,demi,Maybe I should warn him about you.,4
882,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"I'm sure that you did, Courtney. I have no doubt in my mind that you talked mad *bleep* about me.",4
883,dialogue,,courtney,demi,I think your personality is ridiculous.,4
884,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"...day one that you would... You said, ""I thought I had a big personality ""until I met Demi. Demi has such a big personality.""",4
885,dialogue,,courtney,demi,"Because it's absolutely ridiculous on a different scale, and that was my way of ""complimenting"" you.",4
886,dialogue,,demi,courtney,"No, because I'm secure in myself.",4
887,dialogue,,courtney,demi,I love that you feel like you need to yell.,4

We thought the big explosion at the group date a couple days ago was like, the big finale, but, I mean, no, that was not the finale. Tonight was the big finale.",4
896,testimony,,cassie,aside,"Calling Courtney the cancer of the house was definitely not the right choice of words. But Demi has a rose, so Demi's safe. And who knows what Colton's gonna do?",4

949,testimony,,demi,aside,"Dreams do come true. Ding‐dong! The bitch is dead. Dr. Demi cut out the cancer.
